Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called "Princess." "Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot," said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. "Nobody fills that boot now." Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, "a jolly soul," Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: "Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love." "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye," Pellegrini told the jury. "And that is the very essence of terror." Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. "These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return," Pellegrini said. "Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters." Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. "She traded that in for a bat," Campbell said. "She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her." By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. "This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged," Pellegrini said. "Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused." Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as "the enemy," she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. "He knew they were innocents. He even called them that," Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. "But it didn't stop him from murdering them." The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. "There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again," she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. "Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body," she said, and began to cry. "I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere." Were you bleeding? she was asked. "Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone," she said. "I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive." She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. "And then our whole world just exploded," she said. "I unfortunately remember every single detail." She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. "It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand," she told the jury. She said it was "a surreal, out-of-body experience." She remembers thinking, "What was that?" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. "It hurt too much. I just didn't care," she said. "I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain. I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die." And then, she said, "the mom in me" took over. She remembers telling herself: " 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. "Can I get on with my life? Absolutely," she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. "There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable," she said from the witness stand. "The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life." Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. "You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are," she said. "Inclines are very hard." Daily life is literally an uphill battle.

Tokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history. During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive. And this "Abenesia" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda. Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response. Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds. Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds. President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined. But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese. As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed. It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential. Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history. He did express "eternal condolences" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, "Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit." That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past. Many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories, but Abe is mounting a significant retreat from Japan's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s, and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education. He is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship. Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, "Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard." Essentially outsourcing "apology and war responsibility" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely "upholding" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned "mistaken national policy," "self-righteous nationalism," "colonial rule" and "aggression," but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called "masochistic" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, "History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone." Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: "Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses." This cavalier "sh*t happens" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an "alliance of hope." That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored. Shared values?

In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an "alliance of hope." That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored.

Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called "Princess." "Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot," said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. "Nobody fills that boot now." Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, "a jolly soul," Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: "Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love." "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye," Pellegrini told the jury. "And that is the very essence of terror." Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. "These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return," Pellegrini said. "Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters." Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. "She traded that in for a bat," Campbell said. "She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her." By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. "This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged," Pellegrini said. "Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused." Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as "the enemy," she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. "He knew they were innocents. He even called them that," Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. "But it didn't stop him from murdering them." The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. "There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again," she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. "Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body," she said, and began to cry. "I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere." Were you bleeding? she was asked. "Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone," she said. "I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive." She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. "And then our whole world just exploded," she said. "I unfortunately remember every single detail." She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. "It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand," she told the jury. She said it was "a surreal, out-of-body experience." She remembers thinking, "What was that?" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. "It hurt too much. I just didn't care," she said. "I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain. I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die." And then, she said, "the mom in me" took over. She remembers telling herself: " 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. "Can I get on with my life? Absolutely," she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. "There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable," she said from the witness stand. "The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life." Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. "You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are," she said. "Inclines are very hard." Daily life is literally an uphill battle.

Tokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history. During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive. And this "Abenesia" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda. Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response. Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds. Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds. President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined. But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese. As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed. It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential. Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history. He did express "eternal condolences" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, "Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit." That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past. Many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories, but Abe is mounting a significant retreat from Japan's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s, and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education. He is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship. Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, "Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard." Essentially outsourcing "apology and war responsibility" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely "upholding" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned "mistaken national policy," "self-righteous nationalism," "colonial rule" and "aggression," but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called "masochistic" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, "History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone." Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: "Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses." This cavalier "sh*t happens" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an "alliance of hope." That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored. Shared values?

Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: "Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses." This cavalier "sh*t happens" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an "alliance of hope." That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored.

Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called "Princess." "Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot," said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. "Nobody fills that boot now." Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, "a jolly soul," Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: "Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love." "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye," Pellegrini told the jury. "And that is the very essence of terror." Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. "These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return," Pellegrini said. "Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters." Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. "She traded that in for a bat," Campbell said. "She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her." By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. "This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged," Pellegrini said. "Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused." Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as "the enemy," she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. "He knew they were innocents. He even called them that," Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. "But it didn't stop him from murdering them." The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. "There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again," she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. "Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body," she said, and began to cry. "I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere." Were you bleeding? she was asked. "Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone," she said. "I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive." She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. "And then our whole world just exploded," she said. "I unfortunately remember every single detail." She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. "It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand," she told the jury. She said it was "a surreal, out-of-body experience." She remembers thinking, "What was that?" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. "It hurt too much. I just didn't care," she said. "I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain. I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die." And then, she said, "the mom in me" took over. She remembers telling herself: " 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. "Can I get on with my life? Absolutely," she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. "There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable," she said from the witness stand. "The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life." Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. "You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are," she said. "Inclines are very hard." Daily life is literally an uphill battle.

Tokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history. During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive. And this "Abenesia" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda. Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response. Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds. Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds. President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined. But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese. As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed. It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential. Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history. He did express "eternal condolences" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, "Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit." That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past. Many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories, but Abe is mounting a significant retreat from Japan's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s, and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education. He is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship. Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, "Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard." Essentially outsourcing "apology and war responsibility" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely "upholding" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned "mistaken national policy," "self-righteous nationalism," "colonial rule" and "aggression," but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called "masochistic" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, "History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone." Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia.

In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an "alliance of hope." That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored.

Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called "Princess." "Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot," said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. "Nobody fills that boot now." Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, "a jolly soul," Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: "Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love." "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye," Pellegrini told the jury. "And that is the very essence of terror." Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. "These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return," Pellegrini said. "Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters." Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. "She traded that in for a bat," Campbell said. "She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her." By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. "This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged," Pellegrini said. "Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused." Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as "the enemy," she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. "He knew they were innocents. He even called them that," Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. "But it didn't stop him from murdering them." The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. "There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again," she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. "Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body," she said, and began to cry. "I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere." Were you bleeding? she was asked. "Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone," she said. "I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive." She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. "And then our whole world just exploded," she said. "I unfortunately remember every single detail." She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. "It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand," she told the jury. She said it was "a surreal, out-of-body experience." She remembers thinking, "What was that?" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. "It hurt too much. I just didn't care," she said. "I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain. I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die." And then, she said, "the mom in me" took over. She remembers telling herself: " 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. "Can I get on with my life? Absolutely," she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. "There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable," she said from the witness stand. "The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life." Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. "You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are," she said. "Inclines are very hard." Daily life is literally an uphill battle.

Tokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history. During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive. And this "Abenesia" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda. Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response. Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds. Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds. President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined. But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese. As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed. It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential. Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history. He did express "eternal condolences" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, "Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit." That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past. Many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories, but Abe is mounting a significant retreat from Japan's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s, and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education. He is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship. Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, "Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard." Essentially outsourcing "apology and war responsibility" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely "upholding" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned "mistaken national policy," "self-righteous nationalism," "colonial rule" and "aggression," but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called "masochistic" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, "History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone." Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: "Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses." This cavalier "sh*t happens" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an "alliance of hope." That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land.

Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored.

In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an "alliance of hope." That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored.

Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called "Princess." "Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot," said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. "Nobody fills that boot now." Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, "a jolly soul," Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: "Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love." "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye," Pellegrini told the jury. "And that is the very essence of terror." Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. "These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return," Pellegrini said. "Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters." Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. "She traded that in for a bat," Campbell said. "She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her." By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. "This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged," Pellegrini said. "Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused." Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as "the enemy," she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. "He knew they were innocents. He even called them that," Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. "But it didn't stop him from murdering them." The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. "There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again," she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. "Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body," she said, and began to cry. "I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere." Were you bleeding? she was asked. "Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone," she said. "I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive." She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. "And then our whole world just exploded," she said. "I unfortunately remember every single detail." She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. "It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand," she told the jury. She said it was "a surreal, out-of-body experience." She remembers thinking, "What was that?" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. "It hurt too much. I just didn't care," she said. "I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain. I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die." And then, she said, "the mom in me" took over. She remembers telling herself: " 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. "Can I get on with my life? Absolutely," she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. "There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable," she said from the witness stand. "The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life." Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. "You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are," she said. "Inclines are very hard." Daily life is literally an uphill battle.

Tokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history. During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive. And this "Abenesia" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda. Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response. Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds. Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds. President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined. But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese. As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed. It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential. Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history. He did express "eternal condolences" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, "Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit." That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past. Many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories, but Abe is mounting a significant retreat from Japan's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s, and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education. He is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship. Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, "Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard." Essentially outsourcing "apology and war responsibility" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely "upholding" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned "mistaken national policy," "self-righteous nationalism," "colonial rule" and "aggression," but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called "masochistic" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, "History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone." Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: "Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses." This cavalier "sh*t happens" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an "alliance of hope." That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land.

In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses." This cavalier "sh*t happens" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an "alliance of hope." That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored. Shared values?
