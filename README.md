## MACSum
This repository maintains dataset, metrics, and models for TACL 2023 paper [MACSum: Controllable Summarization with Mixed Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05041).


## Overview
MACSum is the first human-annotated summarization dataset for controlling mixed attributes. It contains source texts from two domains, news articles and dialogues, with human-annotated summaries controlled by five designed attributes (Length, Extractiveness, Specificity, Topic, and Speaker).

Here is an example of MACSum. For the same input source text, the system needs to generate different reference summaries (green boxes) for different mixed control attributes (orange boxes).

## Dataset

### Statistics
Statistics of MACSum consist of two parts: MAC-Doc from CNNDM and MAC-Dial from QMSum. Source Len., Ref. Len. are tokens in source and reference. Topic, Speaker are averaged number of topics/speakers.

### Json Files
One can access the train/valid/test set of MACSum via `dataset` folder which includes `macidal` for dialogue domain and `macdoc` for document domain.
The format of one instance in json data is as follows:
```
{
    "metadata": {          // source text information, one can use metadata to locate the original text
      "dataset": "cnndm",  // origin dataset of source text
      "split": "test",     // split of origin dataset
      "file_id": 339       // id of this split
    },
    "source": [ ... ]      // source text split by sentences/turns in macdoc/macdial dataset
    "references": [        // multiple samples containing the same source with different control_attributes       
      {
        "control_attribute": {       // the same as control attributes in paper
          "length": "short",
          "extractiveness": "normal",
          "specificity": "normal",
          "topic": "",
          "Speaker": ""             // only macdial has this field
        },
        "summary": "The 2014 Khumbu Icefall on Everest caused 16 Nepali deaths last year, resulting in at the end of the Nepal season. Mountaineers return to Everest after the deadly 2014 season. To avoid the deadly area, changes were made to the routes. Climbing permits have increased this year.",
        "title": "Nepal Opens Mount Everest Side After 2014 Tragedy",  // title of the summary
        "relevant_turns": [   // two formats: 1) [start, end] (inclusive), or 2) a single number for that turn 
          [
            0,
            49
          ],
          55
        ]
      }, 
      ...
    ]
}
```

## Metrics
We propose two automatic metrics for evaluating the degree of control of generated summary: Control Error Rate (CER) & Control Correlation (CC)

One can find the implementation in `metric` folder:
- `control_correlation_dial/doc.py` computes the CC
- `control_error_rate_dial/doc.py` computes the CER
- `{attr}_only.py` compute the control attribute metric for single {attr}, corresponding to the $f_r$ in the paper.

## Model and Experiments
### Model Overview
The figure below compares different frameworks. For the HP model, the control attributes are prepended to the input to form a hard prompt. For the SP model, the selected prefixes are added together to form a control prefix. HP+SP contains both hard prompts and control prefixes.

### Setting Environment

1. Install the following packages:
```shell
pip install torch==1.8.1+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install datasets transformers==4.9.2  wandb  nltk sentencepiece
pip install huggingface-hub==0.4.0 # ignore the error
```

2. Set ROUGE package

- Create a file ~/.pyrouge/settings.ini
- Write the absolute path of the ROUGE155 to this file, e.g.
```
[pyrouge settings]
home_dir=PATH_TO_FOLDER/ThirdParty/ROUGE/ROUGE-1.5.5/
```

### Run the Model

```
cd model
bash scripts/prefixTuning/run_BART_prefix_{DATASET}.sh
```

One can switch the model type by changing `config_type` in the shell file.

### Experiment Results
Results on MAC-Doc. The performance of the model is better when Control Error Rate (CER) is lower ↓, ROUGE is higher ↑, and Control Correlation (CC) is closer to the golden summary ↕.

### Add a New Task
(READMEs in `./tasks`, `./seq2seq_construction`, `./configure` can also be helpful)

- Add a "Loader" of raw data under `./tasks`. You can search HuggingFace Datasets for possibly useful scripts. If not, you can be a contributor to both this project and the HuggingFace community.
- Add a "Sequence Wrapper" under `./seq2seq_construction` to construct sequence inputs (user request and structured knowledge) and sequence outputs from raw data for the unification.
- Add an "Evaluator" for your task under `./metrics`. If a third-party repository is used, remember to add it to `.gitmodules`.
- (optional) You can add a new "Model" under `./models` for a new model architecture or a new learning algorithm.
- Add a config file for your task under `./configure/{YOUT_TASK}`.
- Add a config file for each of your experiments under `./configure/{YOUR_TASK}`.
