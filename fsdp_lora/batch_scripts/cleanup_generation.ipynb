      " Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" ¼\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community. \"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits. For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.  \n",

He raised funds for the project through Kickstarter and received $1,255 in six days. The armor is made with materials like Kevlar, memory foam, and ¼\" Kydex plastic for strength, protection, and mobility. The cowl was more challenging to make, requiring a mold of Gordon's head, sculpting clay, and a two-part box mold. The final product has been approved by Legendary, and it's been showcased at conventions and universities. Gordon's business, Armatus Design, plans to sell the cowls to the public in a few weeks, with demand coming from various communities such as martial artists, motorcycle riders, and even cosplay enthusiasts. The suit will not have the iconic bat symbol due to copyright issues. After completing his studies, Gordon intends to scale up the business, maintaining it as a one-man operation for now. \n",

Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community. \"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits.

(CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" ¼\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins.

A 21-year-old industrial design student, Jackson Gordon, creates an authentic, functional replica of Batman's suit. He raised funds for the project through Kickstarter and received $1,255 in six days. The armor is made with materials like Kevlar, memory foam, and ¼\" Kydex plastic for strength, protection, and mobility. The cowl was more challenging to make, requiring a mold of Gordon's head, sculpting clay, and a two-part box mold. The final product has been approved by Legendary, and it's been showcased at conventions and universities. Gordon's business, Armatus Design, plans to sell the cowls to the public in a few weeks, with demand coming from various communities such as martial artists, motorcycle riders, and even cosplay enthusiasts. The suit will not have the iconic bat symbol due to copyright issues. After completing his studies, Gordon intends to scale up the business, maintaining it as a one-man operation for now. \n",

Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" ¼\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community. \"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits. For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.  \n",

Beyond his academic life as an industrial design student, Gordon has an intriguing alter ego - the Dark Knight himself, Batman.

      " Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be long in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" ¼\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy.

For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.  Jackson Gordon, a 21-year-old industrial design student at Philadelphia University, leads a unique double life. By day, he is a university student; by night, he transforms into the Dark Knight himself, Batman. Gordon's Batman persona emerged five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay, creating a version of the Batsuit inspired by Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy.' However, the original suit lacked functionality and authenticity, which led Gordon to construct a new Batsuit in September 2014, one that would not limit his mobility and would provide protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Batsuit was designed to be both strong and practical, withstanding knives, punches, and baseball bat impacts, while remaining light and articulate. To achieve this balance, Gordon used expensive materials such as Kevlar, memory foam, polycarbonates, Kydex (or ABS) plastic, and silicone for the cowl. After launching a successful Kickstarter campaign, Gordon raised $1,255 in just six days. He created a durable and functional cowl by using a mold of his head and pouring liquid polyurethane into it.\n",

      " Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be focussed on the topic conventional materials. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" ¼\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says.

He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention.

For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.  Jackson Gordon, a 21-year-old industrial design student, has created a functional, protective Batsuit that mirrors Batman's actual suit from the Dark Knight Trilogy. His motivation for creating the suit stems from his early interest in cosplay. The Batsuit is made of expensive materials such as Kevlar, memory foam, and Kydex (or ABS) plastic, chosen for their resistance to blades and impact while maintaining lightweight and flexible properties. Gordon's creation has garnered attention from the cosplay community, fellow students, and even martial artists, motorcycle riders, and All Terrain Vehicle riders seeking protective gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gordon's Batsuit has been praised for its theatricality, and his company, Armatus Design, plans to release fully adjustable Batsuit jackets for sale to the public in the coming weeks. The jackets will not feature the iconic bat symbol due to copyright issues. As a student, Gordon plans to maintain Armatus Design as a one-man operation, but his innovative and functional design has caught the attention of Legendary, the production company behind the Batman films. \n",

By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" ¼\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community. \"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits. For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.  Jackson Gordon, a 21-year-old industrial design student at Philadelphia University, has a unique hobby outside of his academic pursuits. He is an avid cosplayer and has created an authentic, functional Batsuit inspired by Batman from the 'Dark Knight Trilogy'. The suit is designed for protection and mobility, made with expensive materials like Kevlar, memory foam, and Kydex plastic. The suit has received recognition from the production company behind the films, and has been a hit at conventions. Gordon, who is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu, plans to begin selling cowls from the suit to the public within a few weeks, catering to various audiences such as martial artists, motorcyclists, and cosplay enthusiasts. However, due to copyright issues, the suits will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon intends to keep his one-man business small while he completes his studies at university. \n",

      " The summary focuses on the policy role of Maya Harris in the 2016 presidential election. Maya Harris, the sister of California Attorney General Kamala Harris, has recently taken on a top policy role in the Hillary Clinton campaign. This hire is significant as Maya Harris's resume includes work at the Center for American Progress, ACLU, and community policing reform, among other liberal-leaning organizations. This move is expected to influence the policy initiatives Clinton will roll out and her appeals to women of color, a crucial demographic for the Obama coalition. The summary also touches upon other political events, such as Martin O'Malley criticizing Hillary Clinton through YouTube videos, Hillary Clinton's balancing act between embracing key portions of President Obama's legacy and distancing herself from his leadership style, and discussions about the GOP primary calendar that could potentially favor candidates with strong evangelical connections over establishment favorites like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. \n",

      " Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be focussed on the topic maya harris , policy role. The source text is given below.  Washington (CNN)Early Clinton campaign calculations, the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns, a GOP ticket for the generations, and Republican calendar concerns filled our Sunday trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. 1. Watch the volume as O'Malley uses YouTube to test Clinton pokes . Slowly but clearly, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. How aggressive will he get? Stay tuned -- literally. CNN's Jeff Zeleny says O'Malley enjoys using YouTube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by Clinton, like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver's licenses. \"Every time Hillary Clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from '08 to '16 -- her statement on the drivers' licenses that we discussed and other things -- Martin O'Malley has been releasing a YouTube video showing a speech where he has done something different, so watch for that to continue,\" said Zeleny. \"Those YouTube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race --the liberals love them.\" 2. The \"Obama Factor\": Clinton finds a lot to love, and some distance . Hillary Clinton is a big fan of President Obama's health care law, but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style. So reports AP's Lisa Lerer, who was in Iowa this past week for the Clinton campaign rollout, and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime Obama 2008 rival who, of course, went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state. \"She embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law, for his push for immigration legislation -- but it wasn't all sunshine and light,\" said Lerer. \"She also took subtle digs at his leadership style— she said America was on the wrong track-- I can't believe I'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a Republican.\" 3. In big policy choice, Clinton signals an important campaign focus . In Democratic politics, Kamala is the Harris sister who gets the most national buzz. But Maya Harris is about to play a big role in the question of how Hillary Clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes. Kamala Harris is the California attorney general and a 2016 Senate candidate, for the seat being vacated by Democrat Barbara Boxer. Maya Harris just signed on for a top policy role in the Clinton campaign -- and CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message. \"One clue, I think, is Maya Harris,\" said Henderson. \"Her resume is really a liberal's dream. She has worked at the Center for American Progress, ACLU, she's also done work on community policing and police reforming, and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate.\" \"So I think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that Hillary Clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color, who are so crucial to getting the Obama coalition back together again.\" 4. Walker-Rubio? Rubio-Walker? A general contrast with some GOP buzz . Marco Rubio drew a direct generational contrast with Hillary Clinton when he officially joined the GOP 2106 race, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also often talks of his hope Republicans will look for a next-generation leader as their next presidential nominee. In political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a Walker-Rubio pairing is not limited to inside the Beltway chatter. \"They both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that Clinton and Gore did ... in 1992,\" said Martin. \"But what's interesting is, in New Hampshire over the weekend, I was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates, for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- I heard somebody float the idea of a Walker-Rubio race in 2016.\" 5. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and then? Heading into the 2016 cycle, the Republican National Committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process, including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front-loaded. Now, some big GOP establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar. Florida is usually the next big contest, but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the \"SEC primary.\" It is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress. But what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a Super Tuesday -- or maybe back-to-back Tuesdays -- in early March that include a number of conservative Southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, maybe Louisiana. The shift is one reason former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008. Ditto for Rick Santorum. They did well in the South, but it didn't matter much because John McCain and Mitt Romney, respectively, were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted. Again, there might yet be more changes. But more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites -- people like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio -- and helping those with strong evangelical connections -- like Huckabee and Cruz.  \n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" ¼\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community. \"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits. For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.  A 21-year-old industrial design student, Jackson Gordon, creates an authentic, functional replica of Batman's suit. He raised funds for the project through Kickstarter and received $1,255 in six days. The armor is made with materials like Kevlar, memory foam, and ¼\" Kydex plastic for strength, protection, and mobility. The cowl was more challenging to make, requiring a mold of Gordon's head, sculpting clay, and a two-part box mold. The final product has been approved by Legendary, and it's been showcased at conventions and universities. Gordon's business, Armatus Design, plans to sell the cowls to the public in a few weeks, with demand coming from various communities such as martial artists, motorcycle riders, and even cosplay enthusiasts. The suit will not have the iconic bat symbol due to copyright issues. After completing his studies, Gordon intends to scale up the business, maintaining it as a one-man operation for now.\n",

Due to demand, Gordon plans to sell the cowls from his Batsuit design on his Armatus Design website in the near future, attracting interest not just from the cosplay community, but also martial artists, motorcyclists, and All Terrain Vehicle riders. Despite being a one-man operation, the Batsuit and Armatus Design will continue during Gordon's university studies.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be normal in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" ¼\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community. \"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits. For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.  Jackson Gordon, a 21-year-old industrial design student, crafts an exceptional Batsuit that offers both functionality and protection. His interest in cosplay and the Batman character led him to design a fully-functioning suit that could withstand various impacts and offer mobility. He utilized expensive materials like Kevlar, memory foam, and Kydex to create a suit resistant to slashes, blows, and even knife stabs, yet breathable and wearable. A Kickstarter campaign raised funds for the project, garnering approval from Legendary, the production company behind the Batman films. The suit has been well-received, with Gordon already manufacturing and selling cowls for the public. The versatility of the suit has attracted requests from various communities, including martial artists and motorcyclists, despite the absence of the iconic bat symbol to avoid copyright issues.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  Washington (CNN)Early Clinton campaign calculations, the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns, a GOP ticket for the generations, and Republican calendar concerns filled our Sunday trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. 1. Watch the volume as O'Malley uses YouTube to test Clinton pokes . Slowly but clearly, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. How aggressive will he get? Stay tuned -- literally. CNN's Jeff Zeleny says O'Malley enjoys using YouTube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by Clinton, like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver's licenses. \"Every time Hillary Clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from '08 to '16 -- her statement on the drivers' licenses that we discussed and other things -- Martin O'Malley has been releasing a YouTube video showing a speech where he has done something different, so watch for that to continue,\" said Zeleny. \"Those YouTube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race --the liberals love them.\" 2. The \"Obama Factor\": Clinton finds a lot to love, and some distance . Hillary Clinton is a big fan of President Obama's health care law, but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style. So reports AP's Lisa Lerer, who was in Iowa this past week for the Clinton campaign rollout, and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime Obama 2008 rival who, of course, went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state. \"She embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law, for his push for immigration legislation -- but it wasn't all sunshine and light,\" said Lerer. \"She also took subtle digs at his leadership style— she said America was on the wrong track-- I can't believe I'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a Republican.\" 3. In big policy choice, Clinton signals an important campaign focus . In Democratic politics, Kamala is the Harris sister who gets the most national buzz. But Maya Harris is about to play a big role in the question of how Hillary Clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes. Kamala Harris is the California attorney general and a 2016 Senate candidate, for the seat being vacated by Democrat Barbara Boxer. Maya Harris just signed on for a top policy role in the Clinton campaign -- and CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message. \"One clue, I think, is Maya Harris,\" said Henderson. \"Her resume is really a liberal's dream. She has worked at the Center for American Progress, ACLU, she's also done work on community policing and police reforming, and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate.\" \"So I think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that Hillary Clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color, who are so crucial to getting the Obama coalition back together again.\" 4. Walker-Rubio? Rubio-Walker? A general contrast with some GOP buzz . Marco Rubio drew a direct generational contrast with Hillary Clinton when he officially joined the GOP 2106 race, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also often talks of his hope Republicans will look for a next-generation leader as their next presidential nominee. In political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a Walker-Rubio pairing is not limited to inside the Beltway chatter. \"They both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that Clinton and Gore did ... in 1992,\" said Martin. \"But what's interesting is, in New Hampshire over the weekend, I was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates, for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- I heard somebody float the idea of a Walker-Rubio race in 2016.\" 5. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and then? Heading into the 2016 cycle, the Republican National Committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process, including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front-loaded. Now, some big GOP establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar. Florida is usually the next big contest, but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the \"SEC primary.\" It is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress. But what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a Super Tuesday -- or maybe back-to-back Tuesdays -- in early March that include a number of conservative Southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, maybe Louisiana. The shift is one reason former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008. Ditto for Rick Santorum. They did well in the South, but it didn't matter much because John McCain and Mitt Romney, respectively, were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted. Again, there might yet be more changes. But more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites -- people like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio -- and helping those with strong evangelical connections -- like Huckabee and Cruz.  In this edition of \"Inside Politics,\" discussions revolve around potential primary candidates and their strategies. Martin O'Malley is increasing criticism towards Hillary Clinton, using YouTube videos to spread his opinions. Hillary Clinton, while supportive of Obama's health care law, takes subtle jabs at his leadership style. Maya Harris, sister of California Attorney General Kamala Harris, joins the Clinton campaign as a top policy advisor, signaling a focus on policy initiatives appealing to women of color. The Republican National Committee has altered the presidential nominating process, causing concern among establishment figures that the changes could favor candidates such as Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee in states like Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, and Louisiana.\n",

Los Angeles (CNN)It's more than just one state's internal problem. The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a mandatory 25% cutback in water consumption in all cities. In 2014, one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the California drought. He was often right, according to statistics gathered by Timothy Richards, agribusiness professor at Arizona State University. Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table: . • Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3.88 . • Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $1.89. • Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $3.06 . • Melons by 24 cents a pound to $1.23. • Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $2.91. • Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $2.39. Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February, overall prices are expected to rise this year, because of inflation, U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns said. Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3%, close to historical average increases, Kuhns said. Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown, thanks to a strong dollar. The greenback's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation, Kuhns said. Moreover, the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from California to the other 49 states, she said. What economists don't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought. Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices, she said. \"The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter,\" Kuhns said. \"We are not sure what the exact impact will be.\" The reality is there's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest. While not as bad as California, Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states, the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week. Overall, the Western drought affects more than 52 million people, the monitor says. As a result, consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014, the USDA reports. Straining under a drought that began in 2012, ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. So the cattlemen began culling their herds, Kuhns said. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought. \"There's other areas being affected,\" Kuhns said. It's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore, but let's face it: the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason. Its year-round sunshine. So the next time you take a holiday in California, you'll find a few changes around here, thanks to the drought. Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant. You won't find water waiting for you on the table. Eateries now \"can only serve water to customers on request,\" the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations. Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily. These requests are mandatory under the new regulations. And they'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains. Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared, many ski resorts shut down early this year, including at Lake Tahoe, and some are now building zip lines, mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming, the Sacramento Bee reported. \"If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more, the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are,\" State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March. But what about those yummy California wines, you ask? Guess what. They're only getting better -- because of the drought. Yes, you read that right. The 2014 wine grape harvest was \"third in a string of great vintages this decade,\" the Wine Institute says. \"California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway,\" the institute said in a statement last year. \"A mild winter and spring caused early bud break, although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years.\" Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi. \"Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality,\" she added. \"With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of California wine.\" That may be the only thing to toast about this drought.  The ongoing drought in California, a major agricultural hub, impacts the nation as it grows over a third of U.S. vegetables and nearly two-thirds of fruits and nuts. This drought has led to higher prices for fruits and vegetables, with an expected rise in prices this year due to inflation. Not only California is affected; states like Texas and Oklahoma are also experiencing extreme drought. The drought has increased beef and veal prices in 2014. The drought has affected the tourism industry in California, with restaurants limiting water service and ski resorts shutting down early. However, the wine industry in California has benefited from the drought, producing terrific quality vintages in the last few years. The California drought affects over 52 million people, and its impact on food prices is uncertain due to factors like the strength of the U.S. dollar and the drop in oil prices.\n",

The historic California drought, currently in its fourth year, is not just an internal issue for the state but impacts the entire United States. California is a significant producer of fruits and vegetables, supplying more than a third of the nation's produce. This drought has led to price increases for various grocery items, including berries, broccoli, grapes, melons, packaged salad, and peppers. While the effects of the drought on food prices are uncertain for 2016 due to a strong dollar allowing for more food imports, there is a widespread drought throughout the West and Southwest, affecting states like Texas and Oklahoma. The drought has resulted in increased prices for beef and veal, with projections suggesting a continued rise in beef prices this year. Additionally, the drought has influenced changes in tourist destinations in California, such as reducing water availability in restaurants, fewer homes running decorative fountains, and earlier closures of ski resorts. However, the California wine industry has reported that the drought has resulted in a third consecutive year of great vintages, with a good supply of California wine, possibly the only positive aspect of the drought.\n",

The ongoing drought in California, the state that contributes significantly to national food production, is causing increased prices for fruits and vegetables due to reduced crop yields. The price increase is a result of reduced agricultural output and import costs, with prices for items such as berries, broccoli, grapes, melons, packaged salad, and peppers rising last year. Economists predict further food price rises this year due to inflation, but the impact of the drought is uncertain due to a strong dollar allowing for imports. Other regions such as Texas and Oklahoma are also experiencing extreme drought, affecting over 52 million people in the West and Southwest. The drought is leading to increased beef and veal prices, smaller grazing pastures, and difficulties for cattlemen in those regions. The drought has led to changes in California's hospitality industry, with restaurants not serving water unless requested and some ski resorts shutting down early and converting to other attractions. However, the drought may have a positive effect on the California wine industry, with the 2014 wine grape harvest being described as a \"third in a string of great vintages this decade.\"\n",

Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices, she said. \"The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter,\" Kuhns said. \"We are not sure what the exact impact will be.\" The reality is there's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest. While not as bad as California, Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states, the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week. Overall, the Western drought affects more than 52 million people, the monitor says. As a result, consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014, the USDA reports. Straining under a drought that began in 2012, ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. So the cattlemen began culling their herds, Kuhns said. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought. \"There's other areas being affected,\" Kuhns said. It's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore, but let's face it: the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason. Its year-round sunshine. So the next time you take a holiday in California, you'll find a few changes around here, thanks to the drought. Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant. You won't find water waiting for you on the table. Eateries now \"can only serve water to customers on request,\" the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations. Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily. These requests are mandatory under the new regulations. And they'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains. Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared, many ski resorts shut down early this year, including at Lake Tahoe, and some are now building zip lines, mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming, the Sacramento Bee reported. \"If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more, the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are,\" State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March. But what about those yummy California wines, you ask? Guess what. They're only getting better -- because of the drought. Yes, you read that right. The 2014 wine grape harvest was \"third in a string of great vintages this decade,\" the Wine Institute says. \"California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway,\" the institute said in a statement last year. \"A mild winter and spring caused early bud break, although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years.\" Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi. \"Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality,\" she added. \"With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of California wine.\" That may be the only thing to toast about this drought.  The historic California drought, now in its fourth year, affects the entire United States due to California's significant contribution to the nation's agricultural production. This drought has led to increased prices for fruits, vegetables, and even beef. The prices of berries, broccoli, grapes, melons, packaged salad, peppers, and fresh fruit and vegetables are expected to rise this year. The strong dollar and drop in oil prices are factors that might mitigate these price increases. Additionally, the drought has impacted tourism in California, with restaurants no longer serving water without request, hotels requesting guests' preferences regarding laundered linens and towels, and fewer homes running decorative fountains. Conversely, the California wine industry has experienced a series of great vintages despite the drought, which may lead to a good supply of California wine. The ongoing drought, however, poses severe consequences for the state's water resources if not addressed, potentially affecting the availability of various goods and services.\n",

(CNN)Sophisticated, glamorous and spacious -- when the super-rich go house-hunting they are searching for something special. Real estate in London's swankier suburbs can catch a buyers' eye. Mayfair, Kensington and Chelsea have long been the stomping ground of the elite -- and are now welcoming a new wave of African investors. \"The Africans who are coming into London now are Africans who themselves have worked for their money,\" explains Bimpe Nkontchou, a British-Nigerian wealth manager based in London. \"They have grown in industry and are actually part of the exciting story of the African renaissance,\" she continues. \"It's bringing to London the best of the continent.\" These investors are having a considerable impact on London's property market and they mainly come from just six countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal. Of these, Nigerians are splashing out the most cash when it comes to bricks and mortar in the British capital -- typically spending between $22 and $37 million on securing a property, according to luxury property agents Beauchamp Estates. Their research shows that over the past three years Africans have spent over $900 million on luxury residential property in London. \"The new international African is very well-traveled,\" explains Nkontchou. \"Educated in the U.S., UK and different parts of Europe their taste is definitely more modern and clean.\" 'Safe-Haven' Owning a home in post codes like W1 or W8 -- around the corner from Kensington Palace -- means more than having a place to lay your head. These buildings are investments which are expected to gain even bigger value in the coming years. High-end auction house Sotheby's says that foreign investors see London as a \"safe haven\"  for prime property investments, and ranks the city as the second most important hub for ultra high-net-worth homes. The only spot more important on the planet is New York City. For evidence that London still attracts high-end buyers, look no further than the sale of a penthouse in Mayfair which fetched $40 million earlier this year. Educated thinking . As well as an intelligent investment, many of the African buyers see these houses as a way of maintaining long standing cultural ties with London -- and it's here they want to send their children to school. Harrow, Eton, Cheltenham Ladies College are all among the list of respected institutions that teach the offspring of wealthy Africans. The Nigerian Embassy in London calculates that Nigerian nationals now spend over $446 million per year on fees, tutoring and accommodation at British schools and university. \"West African clients are very much driven by the need to educate their children,\" says Nkontchou. \"Education usually means putting the children on an international stage, and that's one reason why this is feeding into the demand for property in London.\" Indeed, education industry experts ICEF Monitor say there were over 17,500 Nigerians studying in British universities in 2012  -- about 1,000 more than the 2009/10 academic session. And experts are expecting this trend to continue. \"Virtually all the transactions are for end use, not rental investment, which indicates that the African buyer market in London has significant room for growth,\" says Gary Hersham, director at Beauchamp Estates. \"African buyers or luxury tenants in London are currently where the Russians and Ukrainians were five years ago. They have the resources and desire to purchase or rental luxury homes in Prime Central London,\" he adds. \"It is going to be the African century. \"More from Marketplace Africa .

Editor's Note: CNN Marketplace Africa covers the macro trends impacting the region and also focuses on the continent's key industries and corporations .  African investors, particularly from Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon, and Senegal, are investing significantly in London's luxury property market. Nigerians lead the spending, typically investing between $22 and $37 million in London properties. These investors seek not only a safe investment but also a cultural connection, with many sending their children to prestigious British schools like Harrow and Eton. London ranks as a top destination for ultra-high-net-worth homes, attracting high-end buyers, and the demand for property in London is growing, driven by the need for education.\n",

Editor's Note: CNN Marketplace Africa covers the macro trends impacting the region and also focuses on the continent's key industries and corporations .  The summary is as follows: African investors, primarily from Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon, and Senegal, are significantly influencing London's luxury property market. They are investing in properties worth millions, often between $22 and $37 million, in upscale areas like Mayfair, Kensington, and Chelsea. This trend is driven by both the investors' desire for a safe haven for their investments and the need to provide quality education for their children in prestigious British institutions. This influx of African investment in London's real estate market is expected to continue and potentially grow substantially. The report also highlights that this development is part of a broader narrative of African growth and renaissance, as these investors have earned their wealth through hard work and industry. The CNN Marketplace Africa report suggests that London, after New York City, is the second most important city for ultra-high-net-worth homes.\n",

Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)On Day Six of Nepal's tragedy, life triumphed as rescuers pulled an 15-year-old from the rubble of a multistory residential building in one of Kathmandu's hard-hit neighborhoods. A large crowd erupted in cheers as Pemba Tamang was carried out on a stretcher. He was wearing a New York shirt and a blue neck brace, was blanketed by dust and had the look of a deer in the headlights. His rescuer, Inspector Lakshman Basnet of the Nepalese Armed Police Force, said Tamang was responsive and showed no apparent signs of serious injury. He was given an IV drip and rushed from the Gongapur area to a temporary emergency hospital run by an Israeli aid team. The Nepalese rescuers had been working for five hours to locate Tamang after they heard his voice coming from under the debris. Also Thursday, a U.S. special operations forces team rescued 30 people, including three Americans, by helicopter from an area of Nepal called Bamboo Village, according to the U.S. ambassador to Nepal. The group was trapped in the village and living in a makeshift shelter, Ambassador Peter Bodde said. The families had contacted the U.S. government to let officials know where their relatives were stuck, he said. They had no other way to get out of the area, Bodde said. An American disaster response team was also involved in the rescue of the 15 year old boy. The team was at a nearby damaged bus station when it got word that someone might be alive. Andrew Olvera, the head of the U.S. team, said his men rushed over with search dogs and equipment ranging from breaching tools to sophisticated cameras that can probe under the rubble. He said the operation carried enormous risk, as chunks of the collapsed building hung precariously on rebar. Entire floors of what used to be people's homes were visible -- ceiling fans and beds still draped with cotton sheets. It was a mountain of loss and sorrow. \"It's dangerous, but it's what we do,\" said Olvera, who has a daughter and twin 11-year-old boys. \"It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we will risk almost everything. \"The way the building is, it's definitely a miracle,\" he said. Tamang cried for water in a muffled voice. He had been buried for five days under a building that pancaked. He dodged death because of a motorcycle that shielded him from the pressure of the concrete and steel, according to Basnet. And, Basnet said, he \"survived by good faith.\" Dennis Bautista, who went down to where Tamang was buried to administer medical aid, called the rescue amazing. \"It feels good to be able to help out. I can't imagine what he went through,\" Bautista said. \"He is a brave young man.\" Basnet said once he got closer to Tamang, he tried to reassure him that he would be OK. \"I gave him water and talked to him regularly,\" Basnet said. After Tamang was rushed to the hospital, the US Agency for International Development team continued the search. The possibility remained that someone else might have survived, like Tamang. Other search and rescue teams continued to scour through Kathmandu's rubble Thursday. They are looking for survivors from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Saturday, killing at least 6,134 people and wounding almost 14,000, according to Nepali authorities. Another 72 people were reported dead in India and 25 in China. In Nepal, 19 of the deaths occurred on Mount Everest, where the quake triggered deadly avalanches. Despite the disaster, Nepali authorities plans to reopen routes up the mountain as soon as next week. Teams are clearing paths and and rebuilding ladders, Tourism Ministry spokesman Krishna Sapkota told CNN on Thursday. Officials are encouraging people who have already received permission to climb this season to go ahead with their plans. As the chances dimmed for finding people alive in the wreckage left by the quake across Nepal, Tamang's rescue boosted hopes for all those who still have loved ones and friends missing. Other people have been saved from under collapsed buildings in previous days, including a 27-year-old man on Tuesday and a 4-month-old boy on Sunday. The Nepali military also released a photo of a dust-caked 11-year-old girl who they said was rescued Wednesday after 90 hours under the rubble. The rescuers, meanwhile, have no intention of giving up looking for more. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Olvera said, revised the benchmark for what was thought possible for survival. A man there was miraculously pulled from the rubble after 27 long days. 360-degree view of earthquake zone . CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.

It was a mountain of loss and sorrow. \"It's dangerous, but it's what we do,\" said Olvera, who has a daughter and twin 11-year-old boys. \"It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we will risk almost everything. \"The way the building is, it's definitely a miracle,\" he said. Tamang cried for water in a muffled voice.

After Tamang was rushed to the hospital, the US Agency for International Development team continued the search. The possibility remained that someone else might have survived, like Tamang. Other search and rescue teams continued to scour through Kathmandu's rubble Thursday. They are looking for survivors from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Saturday, killing at least 6,134 people and wounding almost 14,000, according to Nepali authorities.

In Kathmandu, Nepal, a 15-year-old boy named Pemba Tamang was rescued from the rubble of a multi-story building six days after a magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck the area. He was discovered by Nepalese rescuers who heard his voice under the debris. Tamang, wearing a New York shirt, appeared dazed but responsive, with no apparent serious injuries. He was given an IV drip and taken to a temporary hospital. A US special operations forces team also rescued 30 people, including three Americans, from Bamboo Village by helicopter, while a US disaster response team helped in the rescue of the boy. Andrew Olvera, head of the US team, risked much to save Tamang, using search dogs and advanced equipment despite the danger. Tamang had survived due to a motorcycle shielding him from the pressure of the concrete and steel, and had been given water and words of reassurance by rescuer Lakshman Basnet. Rescues like Tamang's boosted hope for finding more survivors, with similar cases reported previously, including a 27-year-old man and a 4-month-old boy. Efforts to find more survivors continue, with the Nepalese government planning to reopen Mount Everest routes as soon as next week.\n",

Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)On Day Six of Nepal's tragedy, life triumphed as rescuers pulled an 15-year-old from the rubble of a multistory residential building in one of Kathmandu's hard-hit neighborhoods. A large crowd erupted in cheers as Pemba Tamang was carried out on a stretcher. He was wearing a New York shirt and a blue neck brace, was blanketed by dust and had the look of a deer in the headlights. His rescuer, Inspector Lakshman Basnet of the Nepalese Armed Police Force, said Tamang was responsive and showed no apparent signs of serious injury. He was given an IV drip and rushed from the Gongapur area to a temporary emergency hospital run by an Israeli aid team. The Nepalese rescuers had been working for five hours to locate Tamang after they heard his voice coming from under the debris. Also Thursday, a U.S. special operations forces team rescued 30 people, including three Americans, by helicopter from an area of Nepal called Bamboo Village, according to the U.S. ambassador to Nepal. The group was trapped in the village and living in a makeshift shelter, Ambassador Peter Bodde said. The families had contacted the U.S. government to let officials know where their relatives were stuck, he said. They had no other way to get out of the area, Bodde said. An American disaster response team was also involved in the rescue of the 15 year old boy. The team was at a nearby damaged bus station when it got word that someone might be alive. Andrew Olvera, the head of the U.S. team, said his men rushed over with search dogs and equipment ranging from breaching tools to sophisticated cameras that can probe under the rubble. He said the operation carried enormous risk, as chunks of the collapsed building hung precariously on rebar.

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Several of the world's worst terrorist groups, like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to create societies governed by strict, distorted versions of Sharia law. That means anyone who doesn't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- Christians included. Of course, Christians aren't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations. For example, most victims of ISIS are fellow Muslims who refuse to go along with the ISIS worldview and ruthless tactics. Still, there's ample evidence that Christians have been targeted. The latest came Friday, when an Italian prosecutor revealed that a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda talked about attacking the Vatican back in March 2010. \"This is ... a reminder about the world we're in right now,\" U.S. Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. \"...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world.\" This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples: . Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS\" and correspondence with someone in Syria \"asking him to target a church.\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted. While he didn't elaborate, Molins said that the satellite navigation system in Ghlam's car -- which included a loaded Kalashnikov and more -- had one church's location plugged in. It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. \"All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed,\" the video's narrator says in Arabic. \"To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap.\" The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. \"The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this,\" this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. \"But the Christians never cooperated.\" Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. \"(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down,\" recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as \"a tricky way of doing business.\" \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said, claiming the group's militants are \"bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight.\" Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a \"total failure\" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out \"Oh God\" and \"Oh Jesus\" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,\" a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. \"Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,\" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group's advance there prompted Christian families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to Islam, paying a fine or facing \"death by sword.\" Mark Arabo, a Chaldean-American leader and spokesman for the group Ending Genocide in Iraq, claims that Iraqi Christian children have been beheaded, mothers raped and fathers killed by ISIS militants in recent months. \"This is truly a living nightmare that's not going away,\" Arabo told CNN. \"Christianity in Mosul is dead, and a Christian holocaust is in our midst.\"  Terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab aim to establish societies governed by extreme interpretations of Sharia law, targeting non-conformists, including Christians. Recent examples of targeted violence against Christians include an attack on a church in Paris by a man with links to al Qaeda, the beheading of 30 Ethiopian Christians by ISIS, and suicide bombings against Christian communities in Pakistan. The ISIS beheading of Coptic Christians in Egypt and attacks on Assyrians in Syria and Iraq have also been well-documented. The persecution of Christians by these militant groups is a growing concern worldwide.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be normal in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Several of the world's worst terrorist groups, like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to create societies governed by strict, distorted versions of Sharia law. That means anyone who doesn't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- Christians included. Of course, Christians aren't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations. For example, most victims of ISIS are fellow Muslims who refuse to go along with the ISIS worldview and ruthless tactics. Still, there's ample evidence that Christians have been targeted. The latest came Friday, when an Italian prosecutor revealed that a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda talked about attacking the Vatican back in March 2010. \"This is ... a reminder about the world we're in right now,\" U.S. Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. \"...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world.\" This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples: . Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS\" and correspondence with someone in Syria \"asking him to target a church.\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted. While he didn't elaborate, Molins said that the satellite navigation system in Ghlam's car -- which included a loaded Kalashnikov and more -- had one church's location plugged in. It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. \"All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed,\" the video's narrator says in Arabic. \"To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap.\" The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. \"The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this,\" this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. \"But the Christians never cooperated.\" Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. \"(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down,\" recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as \"a tricky way of doing business.\" \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said, claiming the group's militants are \"bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight.\" Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a \"total failure\" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out \"Oh God\" and \"Oh Jesus\" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,\" a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. \"Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,\" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.

These groups aim to establish societies governed by a strict interpretation of Sharia law, and anyone who disagrees is considered an enemy. Examples of attacks on Christians include the targeted attack on the Vatican by a network associated with Al-Qaeda, the arrest of Sid Ahmed Ghlam in France for planning to attack churches, and the beheadings of 30 Ethiopian Christians by ISIS in Libya. These acts of violence are ongoing and affect not only Christians but also other religious minorities in regions where these terrorist groups operate.\n",

(CNN)Several of the world's worst terrorist groups, like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to create societies governed by strict, distorted versions of Sharia law. That means anyone who doesn't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- Christians included. Of course, Christians aren't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations. For example, most victims of ISIS are fellow Muslims who refuse to go along with the ISIS worldview and ruthless tactics. Still, there's ample evidence that Christians have been targeted. The latest came Friday, when an Italian prosecutor revealed that a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda talked about attacking the Vatican back in March 2010. \"This is ... a reminder about the world we're in right now,\" U.S. Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. \"...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world.\" This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples: . Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS\" and correspondence with someone in Syria \"asking him to target a church.\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted. While he didn't elaborate, Molins said that the satellite navigation system in Ghlam's car -- which included a loaded Kalashnikov and more -- had one church's location plugged in. It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. \"All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed,\" the video's narrator says in Arabic. \"To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap.\" The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. \"The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this,\" this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. \"But the Christians never cooperated.\" Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. \"(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down,\" recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as \"a tricky way of doing business.\" \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said, claiming the group's militants are \"bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight.\" Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a \"total failure\" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out \"Oh God\" and \"Oh Jesus\" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,\" a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. \"Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,\" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group's advance there prompted Christian families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to Islam, paying a fine or facing \"death by sword.\" Mark Arabo, a Chaldean-American leader and spokesman for the group Ending Genocide in Iraq, claims that Iraqi Christian children have been beheaded, mothers raped and fathers killed by ISIS militants in recent months. \"This is truly a living nightmare that's not going away,\" Arabo told CNN. \"Christianity in Mosul is dead, and a Christian holocaust is in our midst.\"  Terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab aim to establish societies governed by extreme interpretations of Sharia law, posing a threat to anyone who doesn't agree with their views, including Christians. Recently, a network associated with al Qaeda planned to attack the Vatican in 2010. The US Representative John Delaney highlighted the ongoing persecution of Christians by militant groups worldwide. In France, a suspect named Sid Ahmed Ghlam was arrested in March 2017 for allegedly planning to target churches, but the group he was working with remains unknown. The ISIS beheading of Ethiopian Christians in Libya this April stands out for the large number of victims involved. Al-Shabaab attacked Kenya's Garissa University College, killing Christians while sparing Muslims. Similar attacks have occurred in other countries such as Pakistan and Syria, where modern-day Assyrians continue to struggle against ISIS. The number of Christians in Iraq has significantly decreased due to violence from ISIS, resulting in a living nightmare for many Christian communities.\n",

Despite attempts by some authorities to dismiss such attacks as isolated incidents, there is growing evidence that Christianity is being deliberately targeted by these militant groups. The summary concludes with the assertion that these acts of terror have a profound impact on Christians worldwide and underscore the urgent need for global action to protect religious minorities.\n",

It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. \"All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed,\" the video's narrator says in Arabic. \"To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap.\" The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. \"The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this,\" this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. \"But the Christians never cooperated.\" Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. \"(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down,\" recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as \"a tricky way of doing business.\" \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said, claiming the group's militants are \"bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight.\" Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a \"total failure\" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out \"Oh God\" and \"Oh Jesus\" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,\" a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. \"Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,\" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group's advance there prompted Christian families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to Islam, paying a fine or facing \"death by sword.\" Mark Arabo, a Chaldean-American leader and spokesman for the group Ending Genocide in Iraq, claims that Iraqi Christian children have been beheaded, mothers raped and fathers killed by ISIS militants in recent months. \"This is truly a living nightmare that's not going away,\" Arabo told CNN. \"Christianity in Mosul is dead, and a Christian holocaust is in our midst.\"  The summary states that various terrorist groups such as ISIS and Al-Shabaab aim to establish societies governed by a distorted version of Sharia law, posing a danger to anyone who doesn't subscribe to their extremist views, including Christians. Recent incidents involving terrorists targeting Christians include the case of Sid Ahmed Ghlam in Paris who was arrested after authorities found evidence linking him to al Qaeda and ISIS, planning to attack churches. In another example, 30 Ethiopian Christians were beheaded by ISIS in Libya. Al-Shabaab also carried out attacks on Christians at Kenya's Garissa University College, killing those who identified as Christian. Additionally, there have been reports of violence against Christians in Pakistan. Overall, these incidents highlight the ongoing persecution of Christians by militant groups worldwide.\n",

(CNN)Several of the world's worst terrorist groups, like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to create societies governed by strict, distorted versions of Sharia law. That means anyone who doesn't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- Christians included. Of course, Christians aren't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations. For example, most victims of ISIS are fellow Muslims who refuse to go along with the ISIS worldview and ruthless tactics. Still, there's ample evidence that Christians have been targeted. The latest came Friday, when an Italian prosecutor revealed that a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda talked about attacking the Vatican back in March 2010. \"This is ... a reminder about the world we're in right now,\" U.S. Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. \"...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world.\" This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples: . Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS\" and correspondence with someone in Syria \"asking him to target a church.\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted.

Evidence shows that Christians have been specifically targeted, with recent examples including a network associated with al Qaeda planning an attack on the Vatican in 2010, the attack on a church in Paris, and the beheading of 30 Ethiopian Christians by ISIS. The attack in Paris was foiled, but similar horrific attacks have occurred, including the killing of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain by a terrorist named Sid Ahmed Ghlam. Ghlam was arrested with weapons and documents linking him to al Qaeda and ISIS, and he is considered a terrorist. In Kenya, Al-Shabaab attackers stormed Garissa University College and specifically targeted Christians, while in Pakistan, suicide blasts targeting Christian communities have occurred. The situation for Christians in Syria and Iraq is particularly dire, with a significant decline in the number of Christians due to the actions of groups like ISIS. These actions represent a living nightmare for the Christian community, with reports of children being beheaded, mothers being raped, and fathers being killed by ISIS militants.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)On Thursday, President Barack Obama revealed that a U.S. drone strike had killed Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, two aid workers held hostage on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Al Qaeda had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the United States and an end to drone strikes. But it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages -- take the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief. On April 20, just two days before diplomats resumed talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a final agreement over Iran's nuclear program, Rezaian's Iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage, conducting propaganda, collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information \"with malicious intent.\" The State Department, Rezaian's employers at The Washington Post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage. Their anger is justified, but the decision should surprise no one: There is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions, humiliate the United States or signal unease. The scale of Iran's current hostage-taking -- not only Rezaian but also Iranian-Americans Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati -- may pale in comparison with Iranian behavior of decades past. But the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern. Consider the original Iran hostage seizure: On November 4, 1979, radical students seized the American Embassy in Tehran, ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days. Often forgotten was what sparked that episode, which occurred more than nine months after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared the Islamic revolution victorious. The problem was a rush to reconcile: At a November 1, 1979, Algiers reception, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, met Iranian Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. According to Brzezinski's own memoir, he told Bazargan that the United States was open to any relationship the Islamic republic wanted. Photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world. Iranian hardliners, meanwhile, were apoplectic that Barzagan was \"betraying\" Iran's revolutionary principles, and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement. Khomeini endorsed their action. \"Our young people must foil these plots,\" he reportedly said. The hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands. Brzezinski's dream of reconciliation became a nightmare. Iran released the embassy hostages as Ronald Reagan took his oath of office, ending its first but not last hostage-taking episode. Iranian proxies seized a number of Americans in Lebanon. Reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages. Putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the Nicaraguan Contras, the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also, much as with Obama's outreach today, to solidify the moderate camp within the Iranian political spectrum. Initially, the scheme worked, but no sooner had American officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free, then kidnappers seized three more Americans. Hostage-taking had simply become another way to collect concessions. Of course, Iran is not alone in such games. Whenever the United States tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold, it faces hostage crises. Take North Korea: Obama campaigned as the anti-Bush on the world stage. \"The notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them ... is ridiculous,\" Obama, then a senator, declared in July 2007. Obama hadn't even marked two months in office when North Korea detained two journalists working for Al Gore's Current TV. A kangaroo court sentenced Laura Ling and Euna Lee to 12 years in prison. It was traditional hostage diplomacy. Former President Bill Clinton traveled to Pyongyang to appeal for their release. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor, Kim Jong Un. North Korea's police force put out word that \"General Kim Jong Un's artifice let former U.S. President Clinton cross the Pacific to apologize to the Great Leader. It was all made possible thanks to General Kim Jong Un's extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics.\" North Korea's deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance. Ling and Lee were neither the first nor the last Americans that North Korea seized during the Obama era. After North Korea torpedoed a South Korean ship, killing 46, Obama sought North Korea's censure in the U.N. Security Council. Pyongyang responded by threatening Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering North Korea. On cue, former President Jimmy Carter arrived to mediate for Gomes' release, called for new talks and, by omission, derailed efforts to hold North Korea accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen South Korean sailors. The pattern would repeat in 2012 when North Korea seized Kenneth Bae, an American whom Kim Jong Un sought to leverage into concessions. The following year, North Korea arrested an 85-year-old Korean War veteran touring the hermit kingdom and, the next year, took two other tourists hostage. Each arrest resulted in a high-level visit, an apology to North Korea that bolstered the dear leader's claims of strength and renewed engagement. Saddam Hussein likewise worked from the same playbook. In March 1995, Iraqi security forces seized two American defense contractors who strayed into Iraq from Kuwait. Sentenced to eight years, they served 114 days before Rep. Bill Richardson, D-New Mexico, a close Clinton ally (and future Cabinet-level U.N. ambassador) flew to Baghdad to retrieve them. The American media lauded Richardson, but his trip was not without cost: Saddam used it to depict Iraq as strong and America as weak. \"President Saddam Hussein ... accepts the pleas by Bill Clinton, the Congress and American people,\" the Iraqi News Agency reported. And so did the Taliban. Fifteen years before Obama traded alleged American deserter Bowe Bergdahl for five high-value Taliban and alleged al Qaeda operatives imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, the Taliban arrested two Americans female missionaries. Their detention -- and threatened death sentence -- came against the backdrop of Clinton-era attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the Taliban; the Taliban, too, knew how holding Americans captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions. So what does Iran's hostage brinkmanship portend? Diplomats drink their own Kool-Aid, and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold. Ego, ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries. Hostages such as Rezaian are canaries in the coal mine, however. Their captivity -- not suave officials and their smooth promises -- show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy.  In the text, it is discussed how rogue regimes, specifically Iran, have historically used hostage-taking as a means to extract concessions, humiliate the United States, or signal unease. Notably, journalist Jason Rezaian was recently charged with espionage by Iran, causing outrage from the State Department, his employer, and fellow journalists. This action is part of a pattern of hostage-taking by rogue regimes during diplomatic talks. The text provides examples from Iran's past behavior, the Iran hostage seizure in 1979, North Korea's detention of two journalists in 2009, and the Taliban's arrest of two American female missionaries in the Clinton era. The summary suggests that these hostage situations are not isolated incidents but rather part of a consistent pattern in which hostages are used as a tool for negotiation by rogue regimes.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be normal in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)On Thursday, President Barack Obama revealed that a U.S. drone strike had killed Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, two aid workers held hostage on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Al Qaeda had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the United States and an end to drone strikes. But it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages -- take the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief. On April 20, just two days before diplomats resumed talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a final agreement over Iran's nuclear program, Rezaian's Iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage, conducting propaganda, collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information \"with malicious intent.\" The State Department, Rezaian's employers at The Washington Post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage. Their anger is justified, but the decision should surprise no one: There is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions, humiliate the United States or signal unease. The scale of Iran's current hostage-taking -- not only Rezaian but also Iranian-Americans Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati -- may pale in comparison with Iranian behavior of decades past. But the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern. Consider the original Iran hostage seizure: On November 4, 1979, radical students seized the American Embassy in Tehran, ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days. Often forgotten was what sparked that episode, which occurred more than nine months after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared the Islamic revolution victorious. The problem was a rush to reconcile: At a November 1, 1979, Algiers reception, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, met Iranian Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. According to Brzezinski's own memoir, he told Bazargan that the United States was open to any relationship the Islamic republic wanted. Photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world. Iranian hardliners, meanwhile, were apoplectic that Barzagan was \"betraying\" Iran's revolutionary principles, and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement. Khomeini endorsed their action. \"Our young people must foil these plots,\" he reportedly said. The hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands. Brzezinski's dream of reconciliation became a nightmare. Iran released the embassy hostages as Ronald Reagan took his oath of office, ending its first but not last hostage-taking episode. Iranian proxies seized a number of Americans in Lebanon. Reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages. Putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the Nicaraguan Contras, the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also, much as with Obama's outreach today, to solidify the moderate camp within the Iranian political spectrum. Initially, the scheme worked, but no sooner had American officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free, then kidnappers seized three more Americans. Hostage-taking had simply become another way to collect concessions. Of course, Iran is not alone in such games. Whenever the United States tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold, it faces hostage crises.

The use of hostages by rogue regimes to extract concessions, humiliate the United States, or signal unease is highlighted as a consistent pattern. Historical examples include the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, North Korea's detention of two journalists working for Al Gore's Current TV during Obama's presidency, and Saddam Hussein's capture of two American defense contractors in 1995. The text implies that diplomats often underestimate the true character and disregard for diplomatic norms exhibited by rogue regimes, using hostage situations as indicators of such behaviors.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)On Thursday, President Barack Obama revealed that a U.S. drone strike had killed Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, two aid workers held hostage on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Al Qaeda had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the United States and an end to drone strikes. But it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages -- take the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief. On April 20, just two days before diplomats resumed talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a final agreement over Iran's nuclear program, Rezaian's Iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage, conducting propaganda, collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information \"with malicious intent.\" The State Department, Rezaian's employers at The Washington Post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage. Their anger is justified, but the decision should surprise no one: There is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions, humiliate the United States or signal unease. The scale of Iran's current hostage-taking -- not only Rezaian but also Iranian-Americans Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati -- may pale in comparison with Iranian behavior of decades past. But the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern. Consider the original Iran hostage seizure: On November 4, 1979, radical students seized the American Embassy in Tehran, ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days. Often forgotten was what sparked that episode, which occurred more than nine months after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared the Islamic revolution victorious. The problem was a rush to reconcile: At a November 1, 1979, Algiers reception, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, met Iranian Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. According to Brzezinski's own memoir, he told Bazargan that the United States was open to any relationship the Islamic republic wanted. Photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world. Iranian hardliners, meanwhile, were apoplectic that Barzagan was \"betraying\" Iran's revolutionary principles, and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement. Khomeini endorsed their action. \"Our young people must foil these plots,\" he reportedly said. The hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands. Brzezinski's dream of reconciliation became a nightmare. Iran released the embassy hostages as Ronald Reagan took his oath of office, ending its first but not last hostage-taking episode. Iranian proxies seized a number of Americans in Lebanon. Reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages. Putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the Nicaraguan Contras, the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also, much as with Obama's outreach today, to solidify the moderate camp within the Iranian political spectrum. Initially, the scheme worked, but no sooner had American officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free, then kidnappers seized three more Americans. Hostage-taking had simply become another way to collect concessions. Of course, Iran is not alone in such games. Whenever the United States tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold, it faces hostage crises. Take North Korea: Obama campaigned as the anti-Bush on the world stage. \"The notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them ... is ridiculous,\" Obama, then a senator, declared in July 2007. Obama hadn't even marked two months in office when North Korea detained two journalists working for Al Gore's Current TV. A kangaroo court sentenced Laura Ling and Euna Lee to 12 years in prison. It was traditional hostage diplomacy. Former President Bill Clinton traveled to Pyongyang to appeal for their release. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor, Kim Jong Un. North Korea's police force put out word that \"General Kim Jong Un's artifice let former U.S. President Clinton cross the Pacific to apologize to the Great Leader. It was all made possible thanks to General Kim Jong Un's extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics.\" North Korea's deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance. Ling and Lee were neither the first nor the last Americans that North Korea seized during the Obama era. After North Korea torpedoed a South Korean ship, killing 46, Obama sought North Korea's censure in the U.N. Security Council. Pyongyang responded by threatening Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering North Korea. On cue, former President Jimmy Carter arrived to mediate for Gomes' release, called for new talks and, by omission, derailed efforts to hold North Korea accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen South Korean sailors. The pattern would repeat in 2012 when North Korea seized Kenneth Bae, an American whom Kim Jong Un sought to leverage into concessions. The following year, North Korea arrested an 85-year-old Korean War veteran touring the hermit kingdom and, the next year, took two other tourists hostage. Each arrest resulted in a high-level visit, an apology to North Korea that bolstered the dear leader's claims of strength and renewed engagement. Saddam Hussein likewise worked from the same playbook. In March 1995, Iraqi security forces seized two American defense contractors who strayed into Iraq from Kuwait. Sentenced to eight years, they served 114 days before Rep. Bill Richardson, D-New Mexico, a close Clinton ally (and future Cabinet-level U.N. ambassador) flew to Baghdad to retrieve them. The American media lauded Richardson, but his trip was not without cost: Saddam used it to depict Iraq as strong and America as weak. \"President Saddam Hussein ... accepts the pleas by Bill Clinton, the Congress and American people,\" the Iraqi News Agency reported. And so did the Taliban. Fifteen years before Obama traded alleged American deserter Bowe Bergdahl for five high-value Taliban and alleged al Qaeda operatives imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, the Taliban arrested two Americans female missionaries. Their detention -- and threatened death sentence -- came against the backdrop of Clinton-era attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the Taliban; the Taliban, too, knew how holding Americans captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions. So what does Iran's hostage brinkmanship portend? Diplomats drink their own Kool-Aid, and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold. Ego, ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries. Hostages such as Rezaian are canaries in the coal mine, however. Their captivity -- not suave officials and their smooth promises -- show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy.  President Barack Obama revealed that a U.S. drone strike killed two hostages, Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, held by al Qaeda on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Similarly, Iranian-American journalist Jason Rezaian was charged with espionage on April 20, 2015, the day before talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran. Hostage-taking by rogue regimes, such as Iran, North Korea, and the Taliban, is a strategy to extract concessions, humiliate the U.S., or signal unease during diplomatic negotiations. The historical example of the Iran hostage seizure in 1979 highlights this pattern, where rogue regimes use hostages to block reconciliation.\n",

(CNN)In the hours after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a community center and apartment complex that local leaders expected to serve as a catalyst for the rebuilding of a long blighted East Baltimore neighborhood went up in flames. The $16 million Mary Harvin Transformation Center was being built in a part of town where half the properties are vacant buildings or barren lots, where unemployment rates reach 25% and poverty and despair is rampant. \"Disheartened and bewildered\" was how the Rev. Donte Hickman, pastor of East Baltimore's Southern Baptist Church, described feeling Tuesday as he surveyed the still-smoldering ruins of the centerpiece of a community rebuilding effort led by his church and a coalition of other congregations. \"I see the hopelessness ... and the emotions of the people but I still see hope in God that we can rise from the ashes,\" he said. \"We can rebuild. This cannot be the legacy of Baltimore.\" The project was to include about 60 senior citizen apartments and a community center. In the works for eight years, the center was to provide behavioral health counseling, support services for people and families with HIV and AIDS, employment training, home and credit counseling, and ex-offender re-entry services, according to documents filed with the state of Maryland. The cause of the blaze was still under investigation. The brick building burned to the ground in the riots that followed Monday's funeral for Gray, who died mysteriously on April 19, a week after Baltimore police arrested him. Anger over Gray's death may have spurred Monday's violence -- including buildings and cars set ablaze by rioters, looting and clashes with the  police -- but members of Baltimore's clergy said it was also spurred by lasting issues with young African-Americans in the city. \"We've been trying to make a major difference, trying to transform the community only to discover that something as tragic as this would take place,\" said the Rev. Walden Wilson II, pastor of Israel Baptist Church -- part of the East Baltimore Minister's Community Development Partnership. \"We saw it coming,\" he added. \"Baltimore is a tinderbox. We have a lot of anger as a result of unemployment. We have a high rate of incarceration.\" High concentrations of poverty, underfunded and failing schools, neglected public housing projects and a lack of employment opportunities have been among the social issues long simmering below East Baltimore's crumbling row houses, according to the local church leaders. \"I think the reason that they burned it is exactly the reason why we needed it,\" Hickman said of the community center. \"We were seeking to restore people while we rebuilt properties. We wanted to effect change in the human community as well as rebuild properties with affordable housing.\" The Rev. Reginald Thomas, pastor of Greater Gethsemane Missionary Baptist Church and member of the coalition, said parts of Baltimore have not recovered from the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Those riots sped up the flight of city residents to the suburbs. Unemployment soared with the disappearance of blue-collar jobs. The drug scourge in the 1980s tore the community apart further. \"The message was that our young people are not valued,\" Thomas said. Recreation centers closed. New prisons were built, Thomas said. Hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into the revitalization of the historic Inner Harbor, a renaissance that eluded communities such as East Baltimore. \"When you look at that kind of despair, when you look at people who notice beauty in a city that they cannot even access, it creates such an undercurrent of anger, frustration and hopelessness, that's not going to be fixed quickly,\" Thomas said. Thomas recalled driving along downtown's Pratt Street on Tuesday, near the Inner Harbor, the streets teeming with National Guardsmen and State Police officers. \"When I left downtown and came into East Baltimore, I see no National Guard, no troopers,\" he said. \"It sends a message that it's a priority to protect the areas of the city where a lot of the money has been poured, where the wealth is. What's missed is, it's really not smart or wise in the long term to try to isolate certain problems in certain neighborhoods. What may start off as one neighborhood's problems soon become the city's problem.\" Hickman said the senior housing complex and community center was to open in November or December. The partner churches are expected to complete other projects offering affordable housing and mixed-use developments in East Baltimore. The center is being built by The Woda Group, a low-income housing developer. Kevin Bell, senior vice president of The Woda Group, said: \"We are fully committed to rebuilding.\" On Tuesday, Michael Bluitt, a representative of HCO Inc., one of the largest African-American church architecture firms in the nation, offered a free conceptual rendering and design consultation for the rebuilding, CNN affiliate ABC2News reported. Hickman, Thomas and other clergy members on Monday night met with gang members in an attempt to stem the street violence. Thomas said it was the first time such a gathering took place. Hickman called it a breakthrough. \"Young people just needed somebody to sit and talk to them and hear them cry,\" Hickman said, looking out over the ruins of the community project. \"This is reactionary. This is emotional. This is frustration. This is, I don't know what else to do. If we can rebuild Iraq, we can rebuild East Baltimore.\" CNN's Miguel Marquez and Brooke Baldwin contributed to this report.  Following Freddie Gray's funeral, the Mary Harvin Transformation Center, a $16 million community project aimed at revitalizing a depressed East Baltimore neighborhood, was destroyed by fire. The center, under construction for eight years, offered senior housing, community services, and employment training. Local clergy believe the riots spurred by Gray's death were driven not only by anger over his death but also by long-standing issues in the city, such as high unemployment, incarceration rates, and lack of opportunities. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Despite the setback, community leaders remain hopeful, vowing to rebuild and continue their efforts to improve the area.\n",

In the works for eight years, the center was to provide behavioral health counseling, support services for people and families with HIV and AIDS, employment training, home and credit counseling, and ex-offender re-entry services, according to documents filed with the state of Maryland. The cause of the blaze was still under investigation. The brick building burned to the ground in the riots that followed Monday's funeral for Gray, who died mysteriously on April 19, a week after Baltimore police arrested him. Anger over Gray's death may have spurred Monday's violence -- including buildings and cars set ablaze by rioters, looting and clashes with the  police -- but members of Baltimore's clergy said it was also spurred by lasting issues with young African-Americans in the city. \"We've been trying to make a major difference, trying to transform the community only to discover that something as tragic as this would take place,\" said the Rev. Walden Wilson II, pastor of Israel Baptist Church -- part of the East Baltimore Minister's Community Development Partnership. \"We saw it coming,\" he added. \"Baltimore is a tinderbox. We have a lot of anger as a result of unemployment. We have a high rate of incarceration.\" High concentrations of poverty, underfunded and failing schools, neglected public housing projects and a lack of employment opportunities have been among the social issues long simmering below East Baltimore's crumbling row houses, according to the local church leaders. \"I think the reason that they burned it is exactly the reason why we needed it,\" Hickman said of the community center. \"We were seeking to restore people while we rebuilt properties. We wanted to effect change in the human community as well as rebuild properties with affordable housing.\" The Rev. Reginald Thomas, pastor of Greater Gethsemane Missionary Baptist Church and member of the coalition, said parts of Baltimore have not recovered from the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Those riots sped up the flight of city residents to the suburbs. Unemployment soared with the disappearance of blue-collar jobs. The drug scourge in the 1980s tore the community apart further. \"The message was that our young people are not valued,\" Thomas said. Recreation centers closed. New prisons were built, Thomas said. Hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into the revitalization of the historic Inner Harbor, a renaissance that eluded communities such as East Baltimore. \"When you look at that kind of despair, when you look at people who notice beauty in a city that they cannot even access, it creates such an undercurrent of anger, frustration and hopelessness, that's not going to be fixed quickly,\" Thomas said. Thomas recalled driving along downtown's Pratt Street on Tuesday, near the Inner Harbor, the streets teeming with National Guardsmen and State Police officers. \"When I left downtown and came into East Baltimore, I see no National Guard, no troopers,\" he said. \"It sends a message that it's a priority to protect the areas of the city where a lot of the money has been poured, where the wealth is. What's missed is, it's really not smart or wise in the long term to try to isolate certain problems in certain neighborhoods. What may start off as one neighborhood's problems soon become the city's problem.\" Hickman said the senior housing complex and community center was to open in November or December. The partner churches are expected to complete other projects offering affordable housing and mixed-use developments in East Baltimore. The center is being built by The Woda Group, a low-income housing developer. Kevin Bell, senior vice president of The Woda Group, said: \"We are fully committed to rebuilding.\" On Tuesday, Michael Bluitt, a representative of HCO Inc., one of the largest African-American church architecture firms in the nation, offered a free conceptual rendering and design consultation for the rebuilding, CNN affiliate ABC2News reported. Hickman, Thomas and other clergy members on Monday night met with gang members in an attempt to stem the street violence. Thomas said it was the first time such a gathering took place. Hickman called it a breakthrough. \"Young people just needed somebody to sit and talk to them and hear them cry,\" Hickman said, looking out over the ruins of the community project. \"This is reactionary. This is emotional. This is frustration. This is, I don't know what else to do. If we can rebuild Iraq, we can rebuild East Baltimore.\" CNN's Miguel Marquez and Brooke Baldwin contributed to this report.  Following the funeral of Freddie Gray, a community center and apartment complex intended to revitalize a long-blighted East Baltimore neighborhood was destroyed by fire. The $16 million Mary Harvin Transformation Center, which included about 60 senior citizen apartments and a community center offering services such as behavioral health counseling and ex-offender re-entry programs, was under construction in an area with high unemployment and poverty rates. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but local clergy believe it was spurred by lasting issues affecting young African-Americans in the city, including high unemployment, incarceration rates, and lack of employment opportunities. The senior housing complex and community center were scheduled to open in November or December. Church leaders are working on other projects to provide affordable housing and mixed-use developments in East Baltimore, with the center being built by The Woda Group. Efforts are being made to rebuild, and a representative of HCO Inc., one of the largest African-American church architecture firms, offered a free consultation for the rebuilding effort. Church members also met with gang members to attempt to stem street violence.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  Tokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history. During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive. And this \"Abenesia\" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda. Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response. Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds. Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds. President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined. But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese. As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed. It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential. Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history. He did express \"eternal condolences\" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, \"Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit.\" That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past. Many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories, but Abe is mounting a significant retreat from Japan's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s, and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education. He is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship. Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, \"Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard.\" Essentially outsourcing \"apology and war responsibility\" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely \"upholding\" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned \"mistaken national policy,\" \"self-righteous nationalism,\" \"colonial rule\" and \"aggression,\" but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called \"masochistic\" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, \"History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone.\" Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: \"Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses.\" This cavalier \"sh*t happens\" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an \"alliance of hope.\" That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored. Shared values?  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's address to the U.S. Congress was criticized for missing an opportunity to address historical concerns regarding Japan's wartime actions in Asia, which continue to be divisive. His ambiguous stance on history, perceived as a retreat from Japan's repentant views, is harmful to Japan's international image, particularly with China and South Korea. Abe's stance on history also hinders trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, and his position on the comfort women system is seen as a step backward. Additionally, his handling of the media and journalists has been criticized, particularly in relation to the Asahi newspaper and the comfort women issue. Contrarily, his remarks on shared values of democracy and freedom were welcomed. However, his support for patriotic education and pressure on textbook publishers has been seen as erasing the comfort women issue from school curricula. Furthermore, the disproportionate base-hosting burden in Okinawa, a contentious issue for locals, was not addressed.\n",

Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, \"Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard.\" Essentially outsourcing \"apology and war responsibility\" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely \"upholding\" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned \"mistaken national policy,\" \"self-righteous nationalism,\" \"colonial rule\" and \"aggression,\" but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called \"masochistic\" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, \"History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone.\" Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: \"Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses.\" This cavalier \"sh*t happens\" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an \"alliance of hope.\" That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored. Shared values?  In his address to the U.S. Congress, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe received a warm welcome from President Barack Obama, despite concerns over Abe's handling of Japan's wartime history. Abe's evasive approach to addressing historical events, particularly the comfort women system of sexual slavery, has been criticized for its lack of sincerity and contrition. This stance is perceived as damaging to Japan's international image, straining relationships with China and South Korea, and hindering trilateral security cooperation. Abe's history-focused policies, such as promoting patriotic education and pressuring textbook publishers, have been criticized for whitewashing history and obscuring state responsibility. In addition, the concentration of U.S. bases in Okinawa, despite local opposition, has sparked concerns about the disproportionate burden on the region and issues of democracy and freedom. These issues, though left unaddressed in Abe's speech, remain areas of concern in the region.\n",

Tokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history. During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive. And this \"Abenesia\" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda. Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response. Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds. Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds. President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined. But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese. As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed. It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential. Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history. He did express \"eternal condolences\" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, \"Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit.\" That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past.

This has been a continuous issue for Abe, who has been accused of evading responsibility and promoting a less repentant view of Japan's past. The Obama administration has prioritized the alliance with Japan and the ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, despite public opposition to Abe's expanded security role within Japan. Abe's stance on history has been criticized for undermining trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, which is seen as essential by the U.S. Abe's remarks on history were seen as evasive, and he avoided directly addressing issues such as the comfort women system of sexual slavery during his speech. His approach to history has been criticized for being insincere, and he has been accused of erasing comfort women from what is taught in schools. The situation in Okinawa, where a majority of U.S. bases are located, was also not addressed in Abe's speech, despite Okinawans' opposition to the base-hosting burden they bear.\n",

Abe's remarks were largely viewed as outsourcing apologies to his predecessors, which has been met with disapproval from many within Japan and abroad. This includes the omission of the comfort women system from his speech, a topic that has been a source of controversy and disagreement. Additionally, Abe's record on democracy and freedom has been called into question due to his government's efforts to silence dissenting voices, including journalists.

But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, \"Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard.\" Essentially outsourcing \"apology and war responsibility\" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely \"upholding\" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned \"mistaken national policy,\" \"self-righteous nationalism,\" \"colonial rule\" and \"aggression,\" but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called \"masochistic\" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, \"History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone.\" Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: \"Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses.\" This cavalier \"sh*t happens\" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an \"alliance of hope.\" That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored. Shared values?  In his historic address to the U.S. Congress, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe failed to address concerns over his revisionist views on history, particularly Japan's wartime actions in Asia. His evasive and ambiguous approach to embracing responsibility has been criticized for damaging Japan's international image, straining relations with China and South Korea, and undermining the bilateral security agenda. Despite President Barack Obama's warm welcome, Abe's stance on history is a major obstacle to trilateral security cooperation with South Korea. Abe's comments were seen as a retreat from Japan's repentant views on history and a lack of empathy and sincerity in addressing past misdeeds. His statements on comfort women and human trafficking have been particularly problematic, as they obscure state responsibility and contravene previous admissions of responsibility. Abe's approach to the press and critics has also been criticized, with allegations of government harassment and attempts to smear the integrity of those who disagree with him. The issue of U.S. bases in Okinawa is another source of contention, as Okinawans have voiced their opposition to the disproportionate burden of hosting bases and find that their democratic expression of opposition is ignored.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)It won't come as news to anyone in America today that the authority to make an arrest carries with it the potential to escalate to lethal force. But the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority (initial stop and question, pulling someone over for a traffic violation) becomes significant because of the potential result (deadly force). A minor traffic stop can be the springboard to a check for outstanding warrants. An initial stop can therefore lead to an arrest. And an arrest, we know, can have fatal results. In South Carolina earlier this month, Walter Scott was the subject of a bench warrant for over $18,000 in unpaid child support, according to court records. That means that once he was stopped, he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion. But failure to pay child support is not a crime. At least, not in the traditional sense, though states do criminalize it. It's rightly a civil matter. Skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either. This means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court isn't about catching criminals -- it's bill collection, only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons, and acting under color of law. This raises some serious questions about what exactly we want our heavily armed law enforcement officers to be doing. Not all \"warrants\" are created equal. Sometimes there are warrants for arrest, which are issued for alleged murders, drug dealing or sexual assault. Then there are cases like the Scott case. Bench warrants for deadbeat dads are not arrest warrants for crimes. Don't get me wrong. Deadbeat and absent dads are one of the most serious and often overlooked threats to our collective well-being today. Forget the school-to-prison-pipeline. Lousy parents are the prison pipeline; particularly symptomatic of this problem are absent and deadbeat dads. Still, given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws, there is ultimately something Dickensian in our remedy for enforcement. First, it's important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court's intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event. Yes, parents who can't resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts, but once the courts and law enforcement are involved, they do things their way. And it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own. South Carolina family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings. Oftentimes and sadly so, papa is a rolling stone, and he falls behind on his payments. When a supporting parent has fallen behind, the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order. At the hearing, that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that, well, he would love to pay, but right now he's just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well-established language of support shirkers. The bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he's too poor to pay his child's support. If he fails to demonstrate this inability, the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him, unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments. What follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon, a game show and debtor's prison. The defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail. If he can't, he'll be stuck in jail until he does pay. And let's face it: While it's hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads, jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to, you guessed it, earn money to pay that debt. Of course, since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant, dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates \"mixed up.\" The court's remedy is to issue a warrant to bring dad to court. That warrant is not technically a criminal arrest warrant, but it sure seems like an arrest warrant if dad gets picked up on a Friday afternoon and has to wait in jail all weekend to see the judge on Monday. The point is this: Some warrants are for the arrest of criminals. Those are the warrants we're familiar with, from \"Law & Order\" and every other cop show. Other warrants, like those for contempt of a support order, have nothing to do with crime. They're bill collection and are essentially civil in nature. Yet we've foisted that duty on the police as an ersatz collection agency. That's right, the same police charged with arresting dangerous criminals are also dragooned into bill collection for the courts. When they run a driver's name on a routine traffic stop and a deadbeat arrest warrant comes up, those same police who are armed with Tasers and firearms are suddenly tasked with arresting a guy for failing to pay his bills. Not because he's dangerous. Not because he's a criminal. Because he's (breathtakingly) financially irresponsible. Walter Scott might have run because he knew the drill. He knew he was going to be arrested. He shouldn't have run. But he also definitely shouldn't have been shot. If he owed $18,000 in arrears, he definitely shouldn't have been looking to buy a Mercedes, as his final words on tape at least seem to suggest he was planning to do. But whether or not he ran, the result would have been the same: If he had a bench warrant, he was going to jail, by force if necessary, even though he does not appear to have committed a \"crime.\" Of course, the counterargument is: If we don't arrest them, how else do we make deadbeat dads pay up? There's no easy answer. But the better question may be: Why do we as a society not shun parents who don't take care of their kids? Social rejection can be an even stronger motivator than the threat of arrest. Arresting deadbeat dads is an extreme solution, and one that could be solved with less government intrusion, and more community involvement. The Scott situation has highlighted some harsh truths. If we continue to arrest and jail deadbeat dads, we can't be surprised when an armed police officer uses excessive and deadly force to arrest them. While no one should be shot for failure to pay support, we're also training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest is an arrest. Are we comfortable as a society using an armed police force, empowered to use deadly force, to aid in collecting these bills? If we are, then we have to be comfortable with the possibility that a delinquent dad is going to bolt when he gets stopped for a broken taillight. And if we're comfortable with that, then we also have to be comfortable with the police giving chase,and making the arrest -- sometimes with whatever force they deem necessary in the moment. Then, our only defense is to watch. And record. Note: An earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime.  This summary discusses the controversial practice of using law enforcement to collect unpaid child support, highlighting the case of Walter Scott who was fatally shot by a police officer after being stopped on a bench warrant for unpaid child support.

It questions the appropriateness of using heavily armed police officers for this purpose, raising concerns about the potential escalation of situations to deadly force.

The case of Walter Scott in South Carolina, who was stopped for a traffic violation and later shot by a police officer, is used as an example.

The article argues that not all warrants are created equal, and that there is a need to differentiate between arrest warrants for crimes and warrants for civil matters like failure to pay child support.

Yet we've foisted that duty on the police as an ersatz collection agency. That's right, the same police charged with arresting dangerous criminals are also dragooned into bill collection for the courts. When they run a driver's name on a routine traffic stop and a deadbeat arrest warrant comes up, those same police who are armed with Tasers and firearms are suddenly tasked with arresting a guy for failing to pay his bills. Not because he's dangerous. Not because he's a criminal. Because he's (breathtakingly) financially irresponsible. Walter Scott might have run because he knew the drill. He knew he was going to be arrested. He shouldn't have run. But he also definitely shouldn't have been shot. If he owed $18,000 in arrears, he definitely shouldn't have been looking to buy a Mercedes, as his final words on tape at least seem to suggest he was planning to do. But whether or not he ran, the result would have been the same: If he had a bench warrant, he was going to jail, by force if necessary, even though he does not appear to have committed a \"crime.\" Of course, the counterargument is: If we don't arrest them, how else do we make deadbeat dads pay up? There's no easy answer. But the better question may be: Why do we as a society not shun parents who don't take care of their kids? Social rejection can be an even stronger motivator than the threat of arrest. Arresting deadbeat dads is an extreme solution, and one that could be solved with less government intrusion, and more community involvement. The Scott situation has highlighted some harsh truths. If we continue to arrest and jail deadbeat dads, we can't be surprised when an armed police officer uses excessive and deadly force to arrest them. While no one should be shot for failure to pay support, we're also training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest is an arrest. Are we comfortable as a society using an armed police force, empowered to use deadly force, to aid in collecting these bills? If we are, then we have to be comfortable with the possibility that a delinquent dad is going to bolt when he gets stopped for a broken taillight. And if we're comfortable with that, then we also have to be comfortable with the police giving chase,and making the arrest -- sometimes with whatever force they deem necessary in the moment. Then, our only defense is to watch. And record. Note: An earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime.  The summary is about the issue of child support enforcement and its implications on law enforcement actions, specifically focusing on the case of Walter Scott in South Carolina. The text discusses how a bench warrant for unpaid child support can lead to an arrest, which can potentially escalate to lethal force. It argues that this practice, while intending to ensure child support payments, raises questions about the role of law enforcement and the appropriateness of using deadly force in such situations. The text suggests that social rejection could be a more effective motivator for delinquent parents, and emphasizes the need for community involvement in addressing the issue of unpaid child support rather than relying on heavy-handed government intervention. It concludes by questioning whether society is comfortable with using an armed police force to collect child support bills, considering the potential for excessive force during arrests. The summary does not mention that failure to pay child support is considered a crime in some states, as stated in a previous version of the article.\n",

(CNN)It won't come as news to anyone in America today that the authority to make an arrest carries with it the potential to escalate to lethal force. But the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority (initial stop and question, pulling someone over for a traffic violation) becomes significant because of the potential result (deadly force). A minor traffic stop can be the springboard to a check for outstanding warrants. An initial stop can therefore lead to an arrest. And an arrest, we know, can have fatal results. In South Carolina earlier this month, Walter Scott was the subject of a bench warrant for over $18,000 in unpaid child support, according to court records. That means that once he was stopped, he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion. But failure to pay child support is not a crime. At least, not in the traditional sense, though states do criminalize it. It's rightly a civil matter. Skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either. This means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court isn't about catching criminals -- it's bill collection, only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons, and acting under color of law. This raises some serious questions about what exactly we want our heavily armed law enforcement officers to be doing. Not all \"warrants\" are created equal. Sometimes there are warrants for arrest, which are issued for alleged murders, drug dealing or sexual assault. Then there are cases like the Scott case. Bench warrants for deadbeat dads are not arrest warrants for crimes. Don't get me wrong. Deadbeat and absent dads are one of the most serious and often overlooked threats to our collective well-being today. Forget the school-to-prison-pipeline. Lousy parents are the prison pipeline; particularly symptomatic of this problem are absent and deadbeat dads. Still, given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws, there is ultimately something Dickensian in our remedy for enforcement. First, it's important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court's intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event. Yes, parents who can't resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts, but once the courts and law enforcement are involved, they do things their way. And it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own. South Carolina family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings. Oftentimes and sadly so, papa is a rolling stone, and he falls behind on his payments. When a supporting parent has fallen behind, the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order. At the hearing, that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that, well, he would love to pay, but right now he's just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well-established language of support shirkers. The bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he's too poor to pay his child's support. If he fails to demonstrate this inability, the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him, unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments. What follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon, a game show and debtor's prison. The defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail. If he can't, he'll be stuck in jail until he does pay. And let's face it: While it's hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads, jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to, you guessed it, earn money to pay that debt. Of course, since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant, dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates \"mixed up.\" The court's remedy is to issue a warrant to bring dad to court. That warrant is not technically a criminal arrest warrant, but it sure seems like an arrest warrant if dad gets picked up on a Friday afternoon and has to wait in jail all weekend to see the judge on Monday.

Then, our only defense is to watch. And record. Note: An earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime.  The summary is as follows: The article discusses the controversial practice of using law enforcement officers to collect child support debts, focusing on the case of Walter Scott in South Carolina. The author argues that arrest warrants for failing to pay child support are not criminal arrest warrants but collection methods, raising questions about the role of police in such cases. The author suggests that these warrant-related arrests can escalate to lethal force, citing the Walter Scott case as an example. The author questions whether society should continue to use an armed police force to collect child support debts and suggests alternative solutions such as social rejection as a stronger motivator for parents to take care of their children. The author concludes by stating that arresting deadbeat dads is an extreme solution and suggests less government intrusion and more community involvement as a possible solution. The summary does not mention the earlier version of the article not making clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime.\n",

She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. \"Nobody fills that boot now.\" Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, \"a jolly soul,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father.

And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: \"Big heart, big smiles, big service.

To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. \"These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return,\" Pellegrini said. \"Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters.\" Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. \"She traded that in for a bat,\" Campbell said. \"She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her.\" By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. \"This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,\" Pellegrini said. \"Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused.\" Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as \"the enemy,\" she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. \"He knew they were innocents. He even called them that,\" Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. \"But it didn't stop him from murdering them.\" The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. \"There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again,\" she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. \"Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body,\" she said, and began to cry. \"I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere.\" Were you bleeding? she was asked. \"Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone,\" she said. \"I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive.\" She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. \"And then our whole world just exploded,\" she said. \"I unfortunately remember every single detail.\" She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. \"It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand,\" she told the jury. She said it was \"a surreal, out-of-body experience.\" She remembers thinking, \"What was that?\" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. \"It hurt too much. I just didn't care,\" she said. \"I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain. I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die.\" And then, she said, \"the mom in me\" took over. She remembers telling herself: \" 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'\" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. \"Can I get on with my life? Absolutely,\" she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. \"There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable,\" she said from the witness stand. \"The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life.\" Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. \"You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are,\" she said. \"Inclines are very hard.\" Daily life is literally an uphill battle.

The jury has found him guilty on all counts and is now determining whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison. During the victim impact phase of the trial, testimonies from the victims' families were heartbreaking, detailing the loss of their loved ones and the lasting effects of the bombings. The prosecution emphasized the cruel nature of the attacks and Tsarnaev's lack of remorse, while Tsarnaev was seen as defiant and unrepentant, raising his middle finger in a profane salute in a courtroom photo taken the day of his arraignment. The victims who survived the bombings described their injuries and the aftermath, including the loss of limbs and the struggle to come to terms with their new reality. The defense will also present testimony during the sentencing phase, aiming to show mitigating factors that may influence the jury's decision.\n",

The prosecutor highlighted the cruel nature of the attacks, as the victims had time to feel pain and fear but no time to say goodbye. Photographs of the victims were presented, showing happy moments with family and friends. The jury was shown a photograph of Tsarnaev in a holding cell, defiantly raising his middle finger, and the prosecutor highlighted his lack of remorse. Additionally, injured victims such as Gillian Reny and Celeste Corcoran testified about the physical and emotional toll the bombings had on them. Corcoran lost both legs and described a surreal, out-of-body experience. Reny had a shin bone snapped and remembered seeing muscle everywhere. Both spoke of their fear of death and struggle to come to terms with their injuries. The prosecution aims to demonstrate the impact of the attacks during this sentencing phase of the trial.\n",

The victims include Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager, Lingzi Lu, a Chinese graduate student, Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy, and Sean Collier, a campus police officer. The prosecution argued that Tsarnaev murdered his victims in a cruel and indifferent manner, leaving permanent scars on the hearts and bodies of the survivors. Jurors also saw photographs of the victims in happier times and were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev giving a profane salute from a holding cell in the courthouse. The sentencing phase of the trial is ongoing, where prosecutors are expected to argue for the death penalty.\n",

Opinion: What Tsarnaev deserves . CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.  The summary is about the Boston Marathon bombing trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Jurors heard emotional testimony from victims and family members during the victim impact part of the case. Four young people, Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, Martin Richard, and Sean Collier, were killed in the bombings. Testimonies were heartbreaking as survivors and families shared their grief and loss. Tsarnaev was found guilty on every count and now the jury must decide whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison. The prosecution argued that Tsarnaev deliberately murdered his victims in a cruel and terrifying manner, knowing they were innocents. The trial continued with testimonies from those who were maimed by the bombings, describing their injuries, fear, and pain. The prosecutors aim to show the impact of the attacks on victims during the sentencing phase of the trial. The trial has been graphic and emotional, and the jury must decide whether Tsarnaev deserves the death penalty.\n",

This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called \"Princess.\" \"Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot,\" said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. \"Nobody fills that boot now.\" Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, \"a jolly soul,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: \"Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love.\" \"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye,\" Pellegrini told the jury. \"And that is the very essence of terror.\" Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. \"These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return,\" Pellegrini said. \"Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters.\" Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. \"She traded that in for a bat,\" Campbell said. \"She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her.\" By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. \"This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,\" Pellegrini said. \"Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused.\" Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as \"the enemy,\" she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. \"He knew they were innocents. He even called them that,\" Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. \"But it didn't stop him from murdering them.\" The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. \"There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again,\" she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. \"Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body,\" she said, and began to cry. \"I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere.\" Were you bleeding? she was asked. \"Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone,\" she said. \"I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive.\" She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. \"And then our whole world just exploded,\" she said. \"I unfortunately remember every single detail.\" She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. \"It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand,\" she told the jury.

The Boston Marathon bombing trial has entered its victim impact phase, during which family members and survivors of the 2013 attack have testified about the emotional and physical toll the bombings had on them. Four individuals, including a 29-year-old restaurant manager named Krystle Campbell, a Chinese graduate student named Lingzi Lu, an 8-year-old boy named Martin Richard, and a campus police officer named Sean Collier, were killed in the attack. Many others were maimed, with some losing limbs. Testimony from survivors has been heart-wrenching, with one senior in high school, Gillian Reny, describing the chilling silence and chaos that followed the explosion near her. Another witness, Celeste Corcoran, recalled the surreal, out-of-body experience she had after losing both legs in the blast. Prosecutors are using the testimonies to argue for the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the alleged bomber, who has been found guilty on every count. They have described Tsarnaev as unconcerned, unrepentant, and unchanged, and as someone who saw his victims as \"the enemy.\"\n",

The Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was found guilty on all charges for detonating bombs that resulted in the death of four young people and injuries to several others in 2013. The victims' families are now testifying in the sentencing phase of the trial, sharing heartbreaking stories of loss, grief, and physical hardship caused by the attacks. The victims included a 29-year-old restaurant manager, Krystle Campbell, a Chinese grad student, Lingzi Lu, an 8-year-old boy, Martin Richard, and a campus police officer, Sean Collier. The jury is deciding whether Tsarnaev should face the death penalty for his crimes. Prosecutors argue that Tsarnaev knew his victims were innocent and acted out of terrorism, causing unnecessary pain and trauma to his victims. The victims who survived the attacks also testified, sharing harrowing stories of their experiences, injuries, and ongoing physical and emotional struggles.\n",

An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. \"And then our whole world just exploded,\" she said. \"I unfortunately remember every single detail.\" She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. \"It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand,\" she told the jury. She said it was \"a surreal, out-of-body experience.\" She remembers thinking, \"What was that?\" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. \"It hurt too much. I just didn't care,\" she said. \"I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain. I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die.\" And then, she said, \"the mom in me\" took over. She remembers telling herself: \" 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'\" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. \"Can I get on with my life? Absolutely,\" she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. \"There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable,\" she said from the witness stand. \"The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life.\" Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. \"You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are,\" she said. \"Inclines are very hard.\" Daily life is literally an uphill battle. Opinion: What Tsarnaev deserves . CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.  The summary of the source text is that the jury in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber, is currently deciding whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison. During the victim impact part of the case, several family members of the four victims who were killed in the bombings testified about their grief and loss. William A. Campbell Sr., whose daughter Krystle Campbell was killed in the first blast, spoke about how she was the light of his life and how no one can fill the space she once occupied. Lingzi Lu's father also testified, describing her as a jolly soul. Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad, and Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service as a big-hearted, big-smiling, big-servicing individual, were also among the victims whose stories were shared. The prosecutor argued that Tsarnaev murdered his victims in a cruel and terrorizing manner, and that he saw them as the enemy. The jury was shown graphic images of the aftermath of the bombings and of Tsarnaev's defiant attitude towards the authorities. The people who were maimed by the bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial, sharing stories of their injuries and their struggles to recover. The jury will use this testimony to determine Tsarnaev's fate.\n",

(CNN)As art, film stills are often overlooked. The photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. Which is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. Haas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, \"Ernst Haas: On Set.\" \"Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films,\" says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. And the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. The photographers \"are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it,\" Jacob said. Such distinction is obvious from looking at Haas' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on. There's a striking picture of Orson Welles in 1949's \"The Third Man,\" hemmed in by the darkness in a way that suggests the shadowy themes of the classic film. Another, of Gregory Peck and Chuck Connors in 1958's \"The Big Country,\" is as dramatic as any full-scale movie duel. (Westerns were a specialty.) But Haas also has a way of documenting the artificiality of film work, whether it's capturing the sprawling, workaday set of 1965's \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" or snapping a relaxed picture of Barbara Streisand as Dolly Levi in 1969's \"Hello, Dolly!\" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The former is particularly interesting: an image of actors splayed on crosses for the crucifixion scene, surrounded by ladders, a camera crane, a painted scrim and several casually dressed crew members. Jacob observes that in each of Haas' images there's an eye for the unusual. The black-and-white work from \"The Greatest Story Ever Told,\" for example, is almost prayerful, while the color images call attention to the artificiality of film. And some of Haas' other color images, especially his work for 1961's \"West Side Story,\" fit in neatly with others in his catalog, as Haas was known for an impressionistic blur of hues that Jacob calls \"the Haas effect.\" Haas died in 1986, and despite being celebrated during his life, his name is somewhat forgotten these days. Jacob hopes that \"Ernst Haas: On Set\" reminds people just what a master he was. \"A lot of these are familiar images, but you don't necessarily associate them with Haas,\" he said. \"On the other hand, people who know Haas well don't actually know this work, because it was work for hire and wasn't ever put together in this way before.\" Ernst Haas was an Austrian photographer who passed away in 1986. He was a member of Magnum Photos.  Ernst Haas, a renowned 20th century photojournalist and Magnum Photos member, is recognized for his striking film stills. These images, often disregarded due to their salesman-like nature, showcase Haas' unique style and talent. Haas' work, despite being entrusted by film industry professionals, has not garnered much recognition posthumously. A new book, \"Ernst Haas: On Set,\" aims to revive interest in his work, which includes iconic images from films like \"The Third Man,\" \"The Big Country,\" and \"Hello, Dolly!\" Haas is known for capturing the artificiality of film production, while also showcasing the unusual in each image. His work spans both black-and-white and color photography, with his \"Haas effect\" contributing to the impressionistic blur of hues in color images like those from \"West Side Story.\" Despite his acclaim during his lifetime, Haas' name has somewhat faded. The book aims to remind viewers of his masterful contribution to film photography.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Police in the Indian city of Malegaon, in the western state of Maharashtra, are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents: Cattle. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a 'mugshot' of their cattle and submit it to the police. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's 'unique features,' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority Hindu population. \"We are creating a database. If we get an information of a cow slaughter, we can quickly go to the resident's place and check whether it is there or not\", Mahesh Sawai, Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN. \"I believe this will be very effective\" So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat. The Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses. Even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years. The slaughter of buffaloes, however, is still permissible. However, beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month-long strike, which ended Wednesday. The traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat. They have now vowed to file a case in the state's high court. Red meat lovers weren't too delighted either, arguing the government doesn't have a right to interfere in an individual's personal preference. Maharashtra is not the only Indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter. Haryana state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison, the toughest penalty in the country. Rajnath Singh, India's Home Minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter.  In the Indian city of Malegaon, police are creating a database of cattle in response to a ban on beef sale and consumption. Residents are required to provide a 'mugshot' of their cattle with details about unique features, to aid in enforcing the law. This measure is in response to a recent cow slaughter case, with the majority Hindu population valuing cows as holy. Opposition to the decision includes beef traders, who ended a month-long strike on Wednesday, and have vowed to file a case in court, as well as red meat lovers arguing against government interference in personal preferences. Similar laws against cow slaughter are also being enforced in other Indian states, such as Haryana, with a promise of a country-wide law from India's Home Minister.\n",

(CNN)Police in the Indian city of Malegaon, in the western state of Maharashtra, are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents: Cattle. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a 'mugshot' of their cattle and submit it to the police. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's 'unique features,' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority Hindu population. \"We are creating a database. If we get an information of a cow slaughter, we can quickly go to the resident's place and check whether it is there or not\", Mahesh Sawai, Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN. \"I believe this will be very effective\" So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat. The Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses. Even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years. The slaughter of buffaloes, however, is still permissible. However, beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month-long strike, which ended Wednesday. The traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat. They have now vowed to file a case in the state's high court. Red meat lovers weren't too delighted either, arguing the government doesn't have a right to interfere in an individual's personal preference.

(CNN)Actress Linda Thompson, Bruce Jenner's second wife, says she can \"breathe a little easier\" knowing her ex-husband has found the strength to publicly declare he is transgender. In a two-hour special that aired Friday, the Olympic gold medalist and \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" star said he has the \"soul of a female\" even though he was born with male body parts. Thompson, who had two sons with Jenner during their five-year marriage, was one of many relatives to cheer Jenner for publicly sharing what she had known for decades. \"I have respectfully kept his secrets private and would have taken his confidences to my grave had he not spoken out,\" she said in a column for the Huffington Post. \"He can finally realize his need to be who he authentically is, who he was born to be. That takes tremendous courage. For that I commend him.\" Thompson wrote that she would not have married Jenner if she had known about his \"gender issue\" when they first met. But she's glad she didn't know because she would have missed the chance to share a life with him, including their two sons. \"Looking back, I'm so grateful to God, the universe, and Bruce that I didn't know, and that Bruce played the role in my life that he did,\" she said in the column. The two met in 1979 at a celebrity tennis tournament at the Playboy Mansion, while Jenner was in the process of separating from his first wife. The two married on January 5, 1981, and made Hawaii their home. Their first son, Brandon, was born in 1981, followed by son Brody in 1983. \"The Bruce I knew back then was an easygoing, down-to-earth, casual, romantic, good and loving man. I was extremely happy to have found such a remarkable partner with whom to share my life. I found him to be honorable and, well, just too good to be true. Just too good to be true indeed,\" she wrote. They were a celebrity \"glamour couple\" of the time, appearing regularly on red carpets, hosting charitable fundraisers and traveling the world together for their careers. Jenner's star grew, and was a man that other men aspired to be, and someone women wanted to be with. \"The Bruce I knew back then was unstudied, affable, and seemingly very comfortable in his own skin. So it seemed.\" Thompson said Jenner told her in 1985 that, despite it all, \"he identified as a woman\" and hoped to move forward with the process of becoming a woman.\" Confused and desperate, Thompson suggested therapy to help her understand what he was going through and \"determine if it was something we could overcome or 'fix.'\" \"I was pretty ignorant of the fact that being transgender isn't something that can be overcome, fixed, prayed away, exorcised or obliterated by any other arcane notion,\" she said. He considered traveling out of the country for gender-confirmation surgery and returning to the United States identifying as female, where his children could meet him as \"Aunt Heather.\" They separated after going to therapy for about six months and Jenner began taking female hormones and removing his hair through electrolysis. As he started developing breasts, his children began to notice -- a claim that Jenner also made in his interview. Thompson says Jenner did not remain a presence in their lives after he married Kris Kardashian, mother of Kim, Khloe, Khourtney and Rob Kardashian. Together, the couple had two children, Kendall and Kylie. Thompson said she forgives Jenner for those years. He has already \"been held prisoner in his own flesh\" and hopes that his life will get easier now. In addition to \"world's greatest athlete,\" she hopes people will remember him as \"trailblazer for the civil rights of the transgender community.\"  Linda Thompson, Bruce Jenner's second wife, expresses relief and admiration for Jenner publicly announcing he is transgender. In a column for Huffington Post, she commends his courage to live authentically. She recalls their happy years together, including the birth of their two sons, and forgives him for the difficult period when he transitioned, hoping people will remember him as a trailblazer for transgender rights.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Last week, California Gov. Jerry Brown ordered mandatory statewide restrictions on water use for the first time in the state's history. His action was driven by a specific crisis unique to California at the moment -- the severe drought now in its fourth year there -- but it has significance for the whole nation. As it has in the past, California is leading the way in recognizing that population and economic growth has to respect the physical limits imposed by planet Earth. California developed the infrastructure and system of legal rights it uses to distribute water at a time when the population was much smaller than it is today -- and when the climate was in an unusually wet phase, historically speaking. This led to a system that all but encourages heavy water use in dry parts of the state, with little consistency in allocation or pricing and little disincentive to waste. This has never made a lot of sense, but the new measures are the strongest acknowledgment yet that it just isn't tenable today in a serious drought. As for the drought: It won't be the last, and surely won't be the worst to come in the remainder of this century. Brown's measures may be temporary, but we can hope that they'll be a step toward a more permanent reformation of the state's water distribution system -- one that includes large agricultural users, who are not included in the current measures, although they are the dominant consumers of California's water. How the drought affects rest of the nation . What California does now has global significance: Lack of clean fresh water is a serious problem in much of the world. On the Indian subcontinent, where supply can't meet the demands of rapid development, groundwater is being depleted much as it is in California, and is an equally unsustainable practice in both places. And my colleagues at Columbia recently published a study arguing that drought in Syria was one of the causes of the ongoing war there. They also presented strong evidence that the Syrian drought was in part attributable to human-induced climate change -- in itself, another physical constraint the planet places on growth. Our energy systems, like our water systems, are not sustainable. Is the California drought a consequence of climate change? A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report for which my colleague Richard Seager was lead author, argued that it isn't (though the authors acknowledge that global warming makes the drought worse by increasing evaporation from the soil). California, and southwestern North America, indeed saw worse \"megadroughts\" in the pre-Columbian past, long before any humans burned fossil fuels. At the same time, the latest projections are that the odds of such megadroughts are increasing with warming. So we're left with a complex picture, one typical of many extreme weather events. We know that human-induced climate change is increasing the risk that an event such as this will happen, while at the same time we can't strongly blame climate change for the specific event happening right now. Does it matter whether the drought is climate-change-induced or not? From a pragmatic public relations perspective, maybe. Extreme weather events make people aware that we are all vulnerable to them, and media coverage can draw attention to the scientific evidence that climate change is increasing the risks. At least in principle, this awareness can help to build the constituency for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I lived in Australia for a year in 2007-08 when the country was well into a drought that lasted about a dozen years -- and that led to water restrictions in nearly all the country's major cities. Though the role of greenhouse gases in that drought wasn't clear either, the hardship nonetheless made Australians much more concerned about climate change than Americans were at the time. Polls showed that the issue played a significant role in the national elections held during my year there, with a climate-denialist government falling to a much more climate-proactive one (though the pendulum has since swung back). But being able to blame climate change for a specific extreme weather event shouldn't be the only thing to spur action on reducing greenhouse gases. Whether we're talking about a drought in California, a hurricane on the East Coast, a flood in the Midwest or a tornado outbreak on the Plains, the connection of a single event to climate change is likely to be the subject of legitimate scientific controversy. The reality and seriousness of human-caused global warming, however, isn't. The scientific case that human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate, and that these changes pose serious risks to humans and other species, doesn't rest on single-event attribution, but rather on the statistics of large sets of weather events. That big picture is what should motivate us. And when it comes to our getting better prepared for the degree of climate change that is inevitable, in many cases it matters even less to what extent a given weather event was human-induced vs. natural. California could have had this drought, and worse, without global warming. Similarly, sea level rise is increasing the risk of coastal floods, but cities such as New Orleans, New York and many others were (and are) too vulnerable already. Because really extreme events are by definition rare, most places haven't seen the worst nature can deliver, even without climate change, in their recent histories. So our development planning has tended to proceed under the assumption that that worst won't happen, leaving us with infrastructures that aren't properly adapted even to the current climate. Many of the measures we need to take to close that gap -- such as making California's water distribution system less wasteful, or New York's subways more flood-proof -- will also help to prepare us for the new climates to come. They may not be enough, in the long term, but they're a start. We call these \"no-regrets\" measures, because they are good ideas regardless of how rapidly or slowly global warming proceeds. If California can teach the rest of us something about how to design and implement such measures for water, it will be an upside to what otherwise is nothing but a slow-moving disaster.  California Governor Jerry Brown implemented mandatory statewide water restrictions due to a four-year drought, setting an example for nation-wide water conservation. The drought won't be the last or worst of this century, and agriculture, a major water consumer, is not included in the current measures. California's water distribution system, developed during a wetter phase and smaller population, encourages heavy water use in dry areas, wasting water. Climate change is not definitively linked to the California drought, but the severity and frequency of droughts may increase as the planet warms. The drought's impact on the nation and the world is significant; water scarcity is a global problem, similar to California's issue in other parts of the world. The connection of a specific extreme weather event to climate change is often debatable, but the overall reality and risks of human-induced global warming are not. \"No-regrets\" measures, like making California's water distribution system more efficient, can help prepare for future climates and reduce waste, even if climate change is not the sole cause of the event.\n",

California Governor Jerry Brown has implemented mandatory statewide water restrictions for the first time due to a four-year-long drought. This action is significant as it highlights the need for sustainable water management in light of population and economic growth. The current water distribution system, developed in a smaller population and historically wet phase, encourages water waste and does not effectively allocate or price water. The new measures aim to address this issue, but exclude large agricultural users. The drought is not solely attributed to climate change, but its occurrence is influenced by it. The global implications of California's water management are profound, as water scarcity is a major issue in many parts of the world, including India and Syria. The drought in Syria has been linked to human-induced climate change, contributing to ongoing conflicts. The California drought can serve as a wake-up call for addressing climate change, regardless of whether specific extreme weather events can be directly attributed to it.

California Governor Jerry Brown has instituted mandatory statewide water restrictions for the first time due to a four-year drought. This action signals a recognition that population and economic growth must respect the planet's physical limits. California's water distribution system, developed during a wetter historical phase and with a smaller population, encourages heavy water usage in dry areas. Brown's measures aim to address the current drought but may pave the way for a more permanent reform of the state's water distribution system. The drought affects not just California but also has global significance, as lack of clean fresh water is a serious problem in many parts of the world. California's response to the drought may serve as an example for addressing water scarcity in other regions, particularly in the face of climate change, which is increasing the risk of droughts and other extreme weather events. The connection between specific extreme weather events and climate change can be a subject of scientific controversy, but the reality and seriousness of human-caused global warming is not. Adopting water conservation measures can help prepare for future climate changes, regardless of whether they are human-induced or natural.\n",

All the way,\" he exclaims. \"What does it mean?\" We don't know exactly, but the Internet can't get enough.  A four-rainbow sighting in the New York area's sky sparked widespread fascination on the internet. The double rainbow was reflected due to a smooth water surface beneath it. Similar events, like the viral \"double rainbow\" video from Yosemite National Park, can provoke awe and emotion. An internet user dubbed the \"rainbow spokesman\" expressed amazement at the quadruple rainbow. Despite the lack of specific meaning, the internet continues to be captivated by this rare phenomenon.\n",

(CNN)SPOILER ALERT! It's not just women getting cloned. That was the big twist at the end of \"Orphan Black's\" second season. The kickoff to the new season leads the list of six things to watch in the week ahead. 1. \"Orphan Black,\" 9 p.m. ET, Saturday, April 18, BBC America . The cloning cult sci-fi series remains one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV, thanks in large part to the performance of Tatiana Maslany, who has taken on at least six roles on the show so far, including a newly introduced transgender clone. Maslany told reporters this week that we can expect even more impressive scenes with multiple clones. \"We like to push the boundaries of what we're able to do and the limits of those clone scenes,\" she said. \"So, yes, you'll definitely see more complex clone work this season and that's just because we're getting more comfortable with the technology and we're excited by getting to sort of further complicate things.\" And the introduction of a group of male clones will certainly increase the suspense. \"There definitely is a shift towards the Castor clones that we get to explore them a little bit more,\" she said. The fans of the show, dubbed the \"Clone Club\" have a lot to look forward to when the show premieres on Saturday the 18th, and Maslany is blown away by the response to the series so far. \"We've always been really humbled and really inspired by our fans and by their dedication to the show and their knowledge of the show, and  just how it changes their own lives. It's incredible.\" 2. \"Turn: Washington's Spies,\" 9 p.m. ET, Monday, AMC . The series about spies in the early days of the Revolutionary War returns with a new subtitle, \"Washington's Spies,\" and a new Monday night time slot. Series star Jamie Bell told CNN what we can expect in the second season. \"This year we have a lot more battles; we have the journey of [George] Washington and we're getting under his skin a little bit as well. We also introduce new characters like Benedict Arnold, a very infamous character in American history.\" Bell hopes the series might bring more recognition to the Culper spy ring and everything it did. \"I think there should be a monument to all of the Culper ring somewhere. I was amazed that there is nothing [in Washington] about these people who did something extraordinary.\" 3. \"Game of Thrones,\" 9 p.m. ET, Sunday, HBO .

(CNN)This is week three of an ongoing series: A Catholic Reads the Bible. Read week one and week two. When I started this project, my brother texted me, \"Wait until you get to Lot.\" By Sunday afternoon, I understood what he meant. I am horrified by the story of Lot in Genesis. Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was new to me. I actually hadn't put two and two together that Sodom is the origin of the word sodomy. (Feel free to call me dense as you read this). Lot is the central character in the grim story of Sodom and Gomorrah's demise in Chapter 19. You are introduced to the city by Abraham who tries to save the town. In the preceding chapter, Abraham asks God to agree that if he can find 10 good people in the town, God won't smite it. God agrees. Lot is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town. The men of the town come to seek out the new visitors for \"intimacies.\" Ahem. Yeah. Hospitable bunch, huh? Those \"intimacies,\" we are meant to understand, account for Sodom's wickedness. And I guess meant that the town was doomed. (\"Intimacies\" is the term used in my 1991 edition of the New American Bible. The revised edition refers to \"sexual relations.\") To protect the emissaries from the mob, Lot offers up his virginal daughters. Which. Ugh. Anyway, it doesn't work. There apparently aren't enough good men to save Sodom, which leads to God destroying yet another population in Genesis. Oh, and while Lot's chosen family members flee the destruction, Lot's wife turns around and is turned to salt. She had been warned not to look back. After God destroys Sodom, Lot's daughters worry that there aren't any men left, so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him. They need to have children to keep the human race going, the logic goes, I guess. After reading that section, I put my Bible down. I couldn't read anymore. Then I read it again. What was I reading? What are the morals, the meaning, I'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories? This is not the God that I have known for nearly 42 years. It's not the version of the God I pray to daily. I truly don't believe in a God that wipes out a town in general because of sexuality. Why are they wicked? I don't believe that my God that would go after one group -- any group. The God that I pray to doesn't punish the \"wicked\" like this. I can't comprehend this version of God. I can't believe in that kind of God. There were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that I read. But, I want to be truthful with you, my readers. The Lot story struck me -- hard. I wish that I had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago. But I don't. It could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children. Or it could be a morality tale for the times. The truth is: I don't really know. I just know that my faith doesn't include the idea of such a punitive God. I now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the Bible. And when I read this rough draft to my brother, he said to me, \"You have just hit the tip of the iceberg.\" So, I will continue reading.  The summary of the source text is that the author, a Catholic, is reading through the Bible and encounters the story of Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis. They find this story disturbing due to its portrayal of the townsmen seeking \"intimacies\" with Lot's visitors, which leads to the town's destruction. The author struggles to reconcile this story with their understanding of God and questions why God would destroy a town based on sexuality. The author finds this version of God punitive and incompatible with their faith. They continue reading the Bible to better understand it, but remain perplexed by this particular story.\n",

The author questions the moral implications of such a story, finding it inconsistent with their understanding of God, as they do not believe in a God who would destroy a town because of sexuality.

There were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that I read. But, I want to be truthful with you, my readers. The Lot story struck me -- hard. I wish that I had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago. But I don't. It could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children. Or it could be a morality tale for the times. The truth is: I don't really know. I just know that my faith doesn't include the idea of such a punitive God. I now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the Bible. And when I read this rough draft to my brother, he said to me, \"You have just hit the tip of the iceberg.\" So, I will continue reading.  The summary is about a personal exploration of the Bible, specifically the story of Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis. The author, a Catholic, expresses shock and horror at the gruesome narrative, which they found disturbing and contrary to their understanding of God. The story involves Lot offering his virgin daughters to protect divine emissaries from the town's inhabitants, the subsequent destruction of the cities, Lot's wife being turned into salt for looking back, and Lot's daughters having sex with their father due to fear of extinction of the human race. The author struggles to find meaning or moral lessons in the story and feels it contradicts their belief in a merciful God who does not destroy populations based on sexuality or punishes specific groups excessively. The author plans to continue reading the Bible to gain a better understanding but admits to finding the story of Lot particularly challenging.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be normal in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)This is week three of an ongoing series: A Catholic Reads the Bible. Read week one and week two. When I started this project, my brother texted me, \"Wait until you get to Lot.\" By Sunday afternoon, I understood what he meant. I am horrified by the story of Lot in Genesis. Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was new to me. I actually hadn't put two and two together that Sodom is the origin of the word sodomy. (Feel free to call me dense as you read this). Lot is the central character in the grim story of Sodom and Gomorrah's demise in Chapter 19. You are introduced to the city by Abraham who tries to save the town. In the preceding chapter, Abraham asks God to agree that if he can find 10 good people in the town, God won't smite it. God agrees. Lot is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town. The men of the town come to seek out the new visitors for \"intimacies.\" Ahem. Yeah. Hospitable bunch, huh? Those \"intimacies,\" we are meant to understand, account for Sodom's wickedness. And I guess meant that the town was doomed. (\"Intimacies\" is the term used in my 1991 edition of the New American Bible. The revised edition refers to \"sexual relations.\") To protect the emissaries from the mob, Lot offers up his virginal daughters. Which. Ugh. Anyway, it doesn't work. There apparently aren't enough good men to save Sodom, which leads to God destroying yet another population in Genesis. Oh, and while Lot's chosen family members flee the destruction, Lot's wife turns around and is turned to salt. She had been warned not to look back. After God destroys Sodom, Lot's daughters worry that there aren't any men left, so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him. They need to have children to keep the human race going, the logic goes, I guess. After reading that section, I put my Bible down. I couldn't read anymore. Then I read it again. What was I reading? What are the morals, the meaning, I'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories? This is not the God that I have known for nearly 42 years. It's not the version of the God I pray to daily. I truly don't believe in a God that wipes out a town in general because of sexuality. Why are they wicked? I don't believe that my God that would go after one group -- any group. The God that I pray to doesn't punish the \"wicked\" like this. I can't comprehend this version of God. I can't believe in that kind of God. There were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that I read. But, I want to be truthful with you, my readers. The Lot story struck me -- hard. I wish that I had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago. But I don't. It could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children. Or it could be a morality tale for the times. The truth is: I don't really know. I just know that my faith doesn't include the idea of such a punitive God. I now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the Bible. And when I read this rough draft to my brother, he said to me, \"You have just hit the tip of the iceberg.\" So, I will continue reading.  In the third week of a personal Bible reading series, the reader encounters the story of Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis. The reader finds the narrative disturbing, particularly the town's demise due to its citizens' sexual immorality. The story involves Lot offering his virgin daughters to protect divine emissaries, the town's attempt to violate the emissaries, Lot's wife being turned to salt for looking back, and Lot's daughters getting him drunk and having sex with him to continue the human race. The reader expresses discomfort with the portrayal of God as a punitive deity, finding it incompatible with their understanding and beliefs. The reader acknowledges the difficulty of understanding the reasons for such stories and the possibility that they serve as morality tales. The reader plans to continue reading the Bible but remains uncertain about its meanings and interpretations.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  Atlanta (CNN)Federal marshals have arrested Scott Kelley, a fugitive accused of kidnapping who was featured on CNN's \"The Hunt.\" Kelley, 50, was taken into custody at the Atlanta airport Wednesday after arriving on a flight from Costa Rica, Deputy U.S. Marshal Jamie Berry said. \"It was time to come home,\" Kelley told People magazine about his decision to return to the United States. Kelley has been wanted since 2004, accused of noncustodial kidnapping and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. His wife, Genevieve Kelley, who's charged with the same crimes, turned herself in to authorities last year, just a few months after the case was featured on CNN's \"The Hunt.\" Her trial is scheduled to start next month. The couple is accused of leaving New Hampshire, kidnapping Genevieve Kelley's daughter, Mary Nunes, and beginning a life on the lam when she was 8 years old. At the time, the child's father, Mark Nunes, had full custody rights. The search for the three spanned the United States, Canada and Central and South America. It ended on Monday, when Scott Kelley and Mary Nunes entered the U.S. Consulate in Costa Rica and requested passports so they could return to the United States. The consulate notified U.S. Marshals, Berry said, and when Kelley and Nunes flew to Atlanta on Wednesday investigators were waiting for them. Mary Nunes, now 19, was interviewed by investigators at the Atlanta airport to ensure her health and safety and then allowed to continue to her final destination, Berry said. Previously, authorities had said her whereabouts were unknown. CNN New Hampshire affiliate WMUR reported that the daughter plans to testify at her mother's trial. In a statement released through a private investigator he's hired in the case, her father said that he was thrilled to learn Mary is safe. \"We love Mary and are overjoyed that she is alive and back in the US. Our hearts and home are open to her, and we will do everything we can to insure she remains safe and healthy,\" Mark Nunes said in a statement. \"We remain concerned about her emotional and physical well-being. We look forward to the day our family is finally reunited.\" Kelley's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before allegedly fleeing the country, Genevieve Kelley had accused her ex-husband of abusing their child. Investigators found no basis for the accusations and no charges were filed. On a Facebook page defending her, supporters of the mother say she did what any parent would do under the same circumstances. Photos on the page show her standing with friends holding signs that say, \"Justice for Gen! Children need protection.\" Wayne Rioux, who was then the police chief of Whitefield, New Hampshire, told \"The Hunt\" that a video Genevieve and Scott Kelley made, intended to prove their abuse allegations, aroused his suspicions. Rioux watched the tape for \"any evidence of wrongdoing by Mark Nunes.\" \"But throughout the tape all I saw was this bizarre, strange conduct by the mother,\" Rioux said, \"who was absolutely brainwashing the daughter and trying to get the daughter to say things against her daddy.\" Attorney Alan Rosenfeld has argued that Genevieve Kelley had no other option than running away with her daughter, after a court-appointed guardian and social service agencies had said they didn't believe the abuse allegations. \"Simply put, there was no lawful alternative to provide safety for this child,\" he said earlier this year, according to WMUR. Earlier this year, Brazilian police tracked down Victor Arden Barnard, another fugitive who'd been featured on \"The Hunt.\" The 53-year-old American pastor is accused of dozens of sexual assaults in Minnesota. Last year, the same day Genevieve Kelley was arrested, authorities in Texas announced that in an unrelated case, remains found were confirmed to be those of another fugitive featured on the program, Kevin Patrick Stoeser. Stoeser, a U.S. soldier who was dishonorably discharged, pleaded guilty in 2003 to child sexual assault and child pornography charges and was sentenced to 13 years behind bars. Remains of Shane Miller, another suspect featured on the \"The Hunt,\" were found last year. And Charles Mozdir, another suspect who was profiled on the show, was killed in a gunbattle with authorities. CNN's Tricia Escobedo and Slma Shelbayah contributed to this report.  Federal marshal arrests Scott Kelley, accused of kidnapping and unlawful flight, at Atlanta airport. Kelley had been on the run since 2004, along with his wife Genevieve, who is also accused of the same crimes. They allegedly kidnapped Genevieve's daughter, Mary Nunes, when she was 8 years old, evading authorities in the U.S., Canada, and Central and South America. The daughter, now 19, returned to the U.S. Consulate in Costa Rica and was interviewed by investigators before continuing her journey. Mary Nunes plans to testify at her mother's trial, while her father Mark Nunes expressed joy at her safe return. The trial for Genevieve Kelley is scheduled to start next month. Another suspect, Victor Arden Barnard, a pastor accused of sexual assault, was also recently captured.\n",

(CNN)The mother of a quadriplegic man who police say was left in the woods for days cannot be extradited to face charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified \"treatment,\" Maryland police said Monday. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Nyia Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday \"lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby,\" Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks said he could not divulge why Parler was receiving treatment, but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited. She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6. Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. \"The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,\" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. \"This kid's obviously a fighter,\" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. \"It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that.\" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said. \"The aunt was in contact via text message with Nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant, Nyia replied, 'We're OK,' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with Nyia in Maryland,\" according to a police news release. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. When she arrives in Philadelphia, the mother will stand charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, a Philadelphia police spokeswoman said. Walker told reporters she bore \"clear criminal liability in this case.\" There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about \"how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies.\" CNN's Chuck Johnston and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.  A 41-year-old woman, Nyia Parler, remains in treatment in Maryland and cannot be extradited to face charges in Philadelphia for allegedly leaving her quadriplegic son in a park for several days. The incident occurred in Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park, where the man was found on April 6, suffering from dehydration, malnutrition, eye problems, and a back cut that raised infection concerns. Authorities plan to charge Parler with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, and related offenses once she completes her treatment. The man attends the School of the Future in Philadelphia, and authorities are investigating the case further to understand his care situation and the actions taken by various agencies.\n",

Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. \"The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,\" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. \"This kid's obviously a fighter,\" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. \"It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that.\" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said. \"The aunt was in contact via text message with Nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant, Nyia replied, 'We're OK,' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with Nyia in Maryland,\" according to a police news release. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. When she arrives in Philadelphia, the mother will stand charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, a Philadelphia police spokeswoman said. Walker told reporters she bore \"clear criminal liability in this case.\" There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about \"how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies.\" CNN's Chuck Johnston and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.  A Maryland woman, identified as Nyia Parler, remains in treatment and cannot be extradited to Philadelphia to face charges related to abandoning her quadriplegic son in a park. Police allege that Parler left her 21-year-old son in Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park while she traveled to see her boyfriend in Maryland. The son, who also has cerebral palsy, was found lying in the park and was transported to a hospital, where he suffered from dehydration, malnutrition, eye problems, and a cut on his back. Philadelphia authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the son's care and are interested in learning more about the actions taken by different agencies. Parler will face charges of aggravated assault, simple assault, and related offenses when she is extradited to Philadelphia. The investigation is ongoing.\n",

The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Nyia Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday \"lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby,\" Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt.

She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park.

A quadriplegic man suffering from cerebral palsy was left in a park in Philadelphia for more than four days, allegedly by his mother, who subsequently went to visit her boyfriend in Maryland. The mother, Nyia Parler, was taken into custody by Maryland police on Sunday and is currently undergoing unspecified treatment in Maryland. She is being held there, as Maryland police have stated that she cannot be extradited to face charges in Philadelphia until she completes this treatment. The man was found in Cobbs Creek Park on April 6, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby. He suffered from eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition, and a cut on his back that raised infection concerns. Philadelphia police became concerned when he did not show up for classes at the School of the Future, where he is a student, and tried to contact his mother, who eventually responded to them via text message. The mother initially told police that her son was with her in Maryland, but police later learned that he had been left in the park. The boyfriend was unaware of what happened. The mother is currently facing charges of aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, and related offenses in Philadelphia. The case is ongoing, with authorities investigating how the man was cared for and the actions of various agencies involved.\n",

Durham, North Carolina (CNN)President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the country's first African-American woman attorney general is a historic pick. Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride. Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child. Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there. They watched the announcement on television . \"That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands,\" said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch. \"I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy.\" Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's \"fight,\" he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. \"I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood. That is the presupposition of the mindset,\" Lorenzo Lynch said. \"The dual system or the dual treatment.\" When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. \"I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way,\" Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American. \"When it has taken so long, when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different?\" Allison said. In March, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, \"I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay, but it's also the irrationality of the new Republicans.\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans, saying Lynch had been \"asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar.\" Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona's Sen. John McCain. \"I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation, mine and my Republican colleagues,\" McCain said on the Senate floor. \"It was offensive and unnecessary, and I think he owes this body, Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology,\" McCain added. \"I thought he should be commended,\" Lorenzo Lynch said. \"I think that's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry, like most language, is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point.\" Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation . Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch's nomination is because she is African-American. Many point out that Lynch, if confirmed, will be replacing the country's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin. Instead, Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle. For some, it's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate. For others, the delay is retaliation for President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. On the eve of Holder's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice, the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would \"likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate.\" Some of Lynch's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support Lynch's confirmation. In March, several dozen North Carolina women, led by the NAACP, traveled to Washington to meet with their senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. Reportedly, the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial. At a news conference at the Washington Press Club, the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination. \"Senator Burr and Senator Tillis, it is time for you to act like you have some sense. It's past time. You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina,\" Allison said after the meeting. For their part, Burr and Tillis released a statement after the meeting: \"While we remain concerned with Ms. Lynch's stated desire to lead the Department of Justice in the same manner as Eric Holder and will not be supporting her nomination, we are grateful that the group came to Washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas. Weeks later, the NAACP organized protests outside the senators' offices in Raleigh, Charlotte and Wilmington. \"I think there is a much deeper analysis,\" said North Carolina NAACP Branch President Rev. William Barber II. \"I believe if she had been Clarence Thomas, she would have been confirmed.\" \"Because of her courage, her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land, particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear,\" Barber said. Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation 'limbo' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders. He admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of African-Americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights. Now, his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter's nomination and photos of his visit to the White House. Lynch admits that he's never told his only daughter that he's proud of her, although he's sure she knows it. He plans to change that, soon, regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination.  President Obama's nominee for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, is facing a historically prolonged wait for a confirmation vote by the Senate, surpassing the combined wait times of eight previous nominees. Lynch, an African-American woman and the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee vote in February. However, her confirmation has been delayed, with some suggesting race may be a factor. This delay is attributed to ongoing partisan battles, particularly over a human trafficking bill and President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. Supporters of Lynch, including her father and the NAACP, have organized efforts to persuade the two Republican senators from North Carolina, where Lynch's family resides, to support her confirmation.\n",

Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation 'limbo' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders.

President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch, the first African-American woman to be considered for the position, has taken longer than usual to be confirmed by the full Senate. Lynch, a U.S. attorney, was nominated to replace Attorney General Eric Holder and cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in February. However, the confirmation vote has yet to be scheduled, making it the longest wait for a nominee in recent history. Some suggest this delay is due to Lynch's ethnicity, with the Congressional Black Caucus and civil rights activists arguing that race and partisan politics are factors in the delay. Republicans deny this and point to ongoing partisan disagreements, such as over a human trafficking bill and President Obama's immigration policies, as the cause of the delay. Supporters of Lynch, including her father, have been advocating for her confirmation, organizing meetings with senators and protests in their offices. Lynch's family, including her father, who was active in the civil rights movement, remains hopeful despite the delay.\n",

Durham, North Carolina (CNN)President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the country's first African-American woman attorney general is a historic pick. Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride. Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child. Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there. They watched the announcement on television . \"That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands,\" said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch. \"I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy.\" Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's \"fight,\" he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. \"I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood. That is the presupposition of the mindset,\" Lorenzo Lynch said. \"The dual system or the dual treatment.\" When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. \"I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way,\" Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American. \"When it has taken so long, when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different?\" Allison said. In March, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, \"I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay, but it's also the irrationality of the new Republicans.\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans, saying Lynch had been \"asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar.\" Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona's Sen. John McCain. \"I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation, mine and my Republican colleagues,\" McCain said on the Senate floor. \"It was offensive and unnecessary, and I think he owes this body, Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology,\" McCain added. \"I thought he should be commended,\" Lorenzo Lynch said. \"I think that's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry, like most language, is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point.\" Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation . Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch's nomination is because she is African-American. Many point out that Lynch, if confirmed, will be replacing the country's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin. Instead, Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle. For some, it's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate. For others, the delay is retaliation for President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. On the eve of Holder's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice, the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would \"likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate.\" Some of Lynch's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support Lynch's confirmation. In March, several dozen North Carolina women, led by the NAACP, traveled to Washington to meet with their senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. Reportedly, the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial. At a news conference at the Washington Press Club, the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination. \"Senator Burr and Senator Tillis, it is time for you to act like you have some sense. It's past time. You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina,\" Allison said after the meeting.

President Obama's nominee for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, is facing a prolonged confirmation process, surpassing the previous eight nominees' combined wait time. Originally cleared by the Senate Judiciary Committee in February, her confirmation vote has yet to be scheduled, drawing criticism from Democrats who suggest race may be a factor. Despite this, Republican senators deny any racial bias and attribute the delay to ongoing partisan battles, including the stalled human trafficking bill and President Obama's executive actions on immigration. Supporters of Lynch, including her family and North Carolina activists, are advocating for her confirmation, with some travelling to Washington to meet with Republican senators. The NAACP has organized protests in support of Lynch outside the senators' offices in North Carolina. Loretta Lynch's father, a retired Baptist preacher and former civil rights activist, is optimistic about her confirmation, viewing the process as a testament to the depth of fear towards change in American politics.\n",

Washington (CNN)It's the mistake that Hillary Clinton won't make again: ignoring her gender. The low-key video she released on Sunday announcing her run for the White House is filled with women -- young, old, black, white, Asian and Latina -- working in their gardens, taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world. Clinton, who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007, is barely in the video at all, appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others. \"I'm getting ready to do something, too. I'm running for president,\" Clinton said in the video. \"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead.\" Clinton often says there's no better time in history to be born female than the present. She's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation's first woman president. The challenge for Clinton in breaking the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters, while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history. Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics. There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women. Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist. \"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office. There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women & Politics Institute at American University. \"People are ready for a woman president. The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\" According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again . In the run-up to her announcement and at women-centered events, Clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song \"I'm Every Woman,\" and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer. She has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough. She has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, as the reason she wants to remain in public life, a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in Iowa this week with small events. She made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state, as detailed in her book \"Hard Choices.\" Her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women, with Clinton, in a blue cloth coat, holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on. The emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy, which stressed experience and competence over history. But the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasn't possible and didn't make for good politics. \"She is the gender card. She doesn't need to play it because she embodies it. She is the woman candidate. She has shared women's experiences. Being a mom and a grandmother,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. \"She will just naturally bring it in. If she overplayed it, which she won't, it could backfire.\" Republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the Obama years. The Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's president, put it this way at the group's recent annual meeting: \"Eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough.\" Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn acknowledged that many women would like to see a female president in their lifetime but said she didn't think it would be Clinton. \"There's a couple of things there. Trust, honesty -- those get in her way,\" Blackburn said. \"As we talk about the polling that is out there, that gets in Hillary's way and she's not authentic.\" In 2014, Democratic candidates such as former Colorado Sen. Mark Udall proved that the \"war on women\" style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits. Udall lost that race and picked up the nickname \"Mark Uterus\" along the way for his incessant focus on women's issues. And Democrats found that in states such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, white married women and white working class women tended to prefer Republicans. Katie Packer Gage, who has been talking to women in focus groups about Clinton's run, said that to many women, the \"idea of Hillary is more popular than the reality.\" \"She starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different, but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth,\" said Packer Gage, who runs Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that coaches Republicans on appealing to women voters. \"You do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women, but that's a narrow campaign, not a winning campaign. You aren't going to win 100% of women.\" Among Republicans, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina might mount a challenge to Clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first lady's strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men. Fiorina released a Facebook video Sunday in which she said Clinton was a \"highly intelligent woman\" but doesn't have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness. \"She's not the woman for the White House,\" Fiorina said. And among Democrats, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man, a demographic that he has said is left out of the Democrat's increasingly diverse tent. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, has noted that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women, suggesting that the pro-woman framing won't be an easy sell. But Clinton will have some high-profile champions. Moments after her announcement, top Democrats rolled out endorsements, including Barbara Mikulski, the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right. \"Whoopee, Hillary is off and running,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I'm ready for Hillary. And America is ready for Hillary. She is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all.\" At a recent EMILY's List event before announcing her run, Clinton asked her supporters: \"Don't you someday want to see a woman president?\" In that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes. But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches. After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated.  Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign emphasizes women's empowerment, highlighting diversity and progress in the video announcing her run. She aims to be the first woman president, capitalizing on improved climate for women in politics, the \"leaning in\" movement, and growing acceptance of feminism. However, her gender may be a double-edged sword, with some voters fatigued by identity politics. The Republican party may challenge her, with figures like Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul potentially mounting opposition. Despite initial enthusiasm from women supporters, the question of whether America is truly ready for a female president remains complex.\n",

Washington (CNN)It's the mistake that Hillary Clinton won't make again: ignoring her gender. The low-key video she released on Sunday announcing her run for the White House is filled with women -- young, old, black, white, Asian and Latina -- working in their gardens, taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world. Clinton, who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007, is barely in the video at all, appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others. \"I'm getting ready to do something, too. I'm running for president,\" Clinton said in the video. \"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead.\" Clinton often says there's no better time in history to be born female than the present. She's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation's first woman president. The challenge for Clinton in breaking the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters, while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history. Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics. There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women. Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist. \"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office.

But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches. After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated.  In the summary, Hillary Clinton announced her run for the US presidency, emphasizing the empowerment of women in her campaign. She strategically positioned herself as a \"everywoman\" rather than the focus of the announcement video, which showcases diverse women engaged in various activities. Clinton is aiming to make history by being the first woman president, but she faces the challenge of appealing to all voters and generating excitement for this historic milestone. The political climate is relatively favorable for a woman candidate, with a growing acceptance of feminism and a historic number of women in Congress. However, the gender card could potentially backfire, as seen in the 2014 election where the \"war on women\" style of campaigning proved less effective. Republican candidates like Carly Fiorina and Jim Webb could potentially mount a challenge, highlighting Clinton's lack of accomplishments and trustworthiness. Yet, Clinton has gained support from high-profile Democrats, including Barbara Mikulski. The complexity of public opinion across the country means that the question of a woman president will likely not be a straightforward issue in her campaign speeches.\n",

Despite an improving political climate for women, questions remain about whether voters are ready for Clinton as the first female president, particularly among Republican women and white working-class women. Challenges for Clinton include generating excitement, laying out a clear campaign vision, and overcoming concerns about trust and authenticity. Potential opponents, such as Carly Fiorina or Jim Webb, may attempt to neutralize Clinton's strengths as the lone female candidate, while others, like Bernie Sanders, might focus on issues outside of gender.\n",

Mark Udall proved that the \"war on women\" style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits. Udall lost that race and picked up the nickname \"Mark Uterus\" along the way for his incessant focus on women's issues. And Democrats found that in states such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, white married women and white working class women tended to prefer Republicans. Katie Packer Gage, who has been talking to women in focus groups about Clinton's run, said that to many women, the \"idea of Hillary is more popular than the reality.\" \"She starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different, but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth,\" said Packer Gage, who runs Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that coaches Republicans on appealing to women voters. \"You do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women, but that's a narrow campaign, not a winning campaign. You aren't going to win 100% of women.\" Among Republicans, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina might mount a challenge to Clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first lady's strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men. Fiorina released a Facebook video Sunday in which she said Clinton was a \"highly intelligent woman\" but doesn't have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness. \"She's not the woman for the White House,\" Fiorina said. And among Democrats, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man, a demographic that he has said is left out of the Democrat's increasingly diverse tent. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, has noted that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women, suggesting that the pro-woman framing won't be an easy sell. But Clinton will have some high-profile champions. Moments after her announcement, top Democrats rolled out endorsements, including Barbara Mikulski, the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right. \"Whoopee, Hillary is off and running,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I'm ready for Hillary. And America is ready for Hillary. She is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all.\" At a recent EMILY's List event before announcing her run, Clinton asked her supporters: \"Don't you someday want to see a woman president?\" In that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes. But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches. After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated.  In the text, Hillary Clinton announces her presidential campaign in a low-key video, emphasizing the stories and struggles of various women, thereby positioning herself as an \"everywoman.\" This strategy aims to connect with voters and create anticipation about the possibility of having the first female president. Despite a favorable climate for women in politics, the challenge for Clinton lies in presenting a compelling campaign vision that appeals to all voters, not just women, while avoiding a double standard. Some Republicans hope the \"gender play\" backfires, fearing voter fatigue from identity politics. Potential Republican challengers include Carly Fiorina, who argues Clinton lacks a record of accomplishment or trustworthiness, and Jim Webb, who could appeal to white working-class men. Top Democrats have already endorsed Clinton, with Barbara Mikulski expressing enthusiasm about her potential presidency.\n",

Washington (CNN)It's the mistake that Hillary Clinton won't make again: ignoring her gender. The low-key video she released on Sunday announcing her run for the White House is filled with women -- young, old, black, white, Asian and Latina -- working in their gardens, taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world. Clinton, who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007, is barely in the video at all, appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others. \"I'm getting ready to do something, too. I'm running for president,\" Clinton said in the video. \"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead.\" Clinton often says there's no better time in history to be born female than the present. She's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation's first woman president. The challenge for Clinton in breaking the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters, while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history. Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics. There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women. Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist. \"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office. There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women & Politics Institute at American University. \"People are ready for a woman president. The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\" According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again . In the run-up to her announcement and at women-centered events, Clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song \"I'm Every Woman,\" and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer. She has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough. She has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, as the reason she wants to remain in public life, a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in Iowa this week with small events. She made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state, as detailed in her book \"Hard Choices.\" Her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women, with Clinton, in a blue cloth coat, holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on. The emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy, which stressed experience and competence over history. But the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasn't possible and didn't make for good politics. \"She is the gender card. She doesn't need to play it because she embodies it. She is the woman candidate. She has shared women's experiences. Being a mom and a grandmother,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. \"She will just naturally bring it in. If she overplayed it, which she won't, it could backfire.\" Republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the Obama years. The Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's president, put it this way at the group's recent annual meeting: \"Eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough.\" Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Tennessee Rep.

But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches. After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated.  Hillary Clinton has announced her bid for the 2016 presidential election, adopting a low-key approach by highlighting diverse women in a video. In contrast to her 2007 campaign, Clinton is portraying herself as an ordinary woman and emphasizing her connections with everyday Americans. She argues that the current moment is an opportune time for a woman to hold the presidency, but her ability to generate excitement and connect with all voters remains a challenge. The political climate for women in politics appears more favorable this time, with increasing numbers of women in Congress and a growing acceptance of feminism among professional women and public figures. However, Clinton's gender may be both a strength and a weakness; while some view her as an historic figure and a champion for women's rights, others question her trustworthiness and authenticity. Competition for the Democratic nomination may come from figures such as former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, while Republicans may oppose her on the basis of identity politics and criticize her for embodying a gender card. Potential candidates such as former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina could challenge Clinton from the right, while Senator Rand Paul has already questioned her stance on women's issues. Overall, Clinton's campaign strategy is expected to focus on her experience and accomplishments, rather than her gender.\n",

Clinton, who acknowledges the progress of women in politics, seeks to be the nation's first female president, aiming to connect with all voters while generating excitement and anticipation. The strategy is seen as a strategic approach to address the double standard for women in politics, avoiding the overt use of a \"gender card\" that might backfire. The approach could be challenged by Republican candidates, such as Carly Fiorina or Jim Webb, who might focus on different demographic groups. While a majority of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime, support for Clinton is divided along partisan lines. Democrats, including high-profile figures like Barbara Mikulski, have already endorsed her candidacy.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  Washington (CNN)A year after ISIS became a household name in America, using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al Qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents, U.S. prosecutions of would-be recruits have exploded. The flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since January -- is a sign that complicated, manpower-intensive investigations begun when ISIS started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed. But they also highlight the unique challenges that ISIS poses in comparison with al Qaeda, which has attracted fewer U.S.-based recruits. Like a new rock band storming the music charts, ISIS has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda, law enforcement officials said. The group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers. At first, most of the recruits were self-starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming ISIS propaganda from YouTube videos and other social media. Much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer-style videos, some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who ISIS leaders decide doesn't comport with their medieval brand of Islam. But once those initial Western recruits arrived, living in the self-declared ISIS caliphate spanning parts of Syria and Iraq, they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them. In Minnesota, nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to American Abdi Nur, who turned up fighting with ISIS in Syria in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the Middle East. \"Each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here,\" a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said. It's a phenomenon observed in Norway and other European nations, where clusters of young people have been lured to ISIS. And the ISIS recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al Qaeda has had. A decade ago, that group's recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hard-to-reach areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal region. Few Westerners went through the trouble. Minneapolis men allegedly trying to join ISIS highlight role of American recruiter . Today, ISIS occupies much more accessible territory, mostly reachable through Turkey. Istanbul's airport has easy connections to Western Europe and much of the rest of the world. From there, Turkey's modern infrastructure offers quick access to the border regions where smugglers can help jihadis get across to Syria. The informal recruitment networks and ease of travel have presented a difficult puzzle to intelligence and counterterrorism officials, who are used to tracking networks of facilitators and fundraisers that funnel recruits eastward. \"It's harder for us to pick up on,\" the U.S. counterterrorism official said of the peer-to-peer recruitment, which is well below the radar. How ISIS is luring Westerners . Before ISIS, investigators could often focus on radicalizing mosques and clerics to figure out those networks. Al Qaeda recruitment focused on attracting radicals who were motivated to join the fight to protect Islamic holy lands. Much of the recruitment occurred in countries with strong conservative Islamic histories, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, U.S. officials said. In contrast, ISIS takes a somewhat secular approach, portraying how much better life purportedly is in the caliphate as compared to the corrupt West. And people attracted to ISIS' marketing run the gamut from rich to poor, educated to dropout, male to female, teenaged to middle-aged. There are signs Western recruits have risen to high levels in the ISIS organization, with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda, counterterrorism and intelligence officials said. The English is proper, with fewer grammatical and spelling mistakes. And while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are succeeding in their disruption efforts, it also means that U.S. authorities don't see the lure of ISIS receding any time soon. \"We are opening cases quicker than we are closing them,\" the U.S. counterterrorism official said. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West?  The summary is as follows: After a year, ISIS recruitment cases in the U.S. have significantly increased, with at least 25 arrests since January. This surge in investigations indicates ongoing complex inquiries initiated when ISIS seized territories a year ago. ISIS' propaganda, amplified by the media, has been instrumental in its rapid recruitment. Unlike Al Qaeda, ISIS has attracted more U.S.-based recruits. Its initial self-starters were radicalized by consuming ISIS propaganda online, and upon reaching ISIS-controlled territories, they recruited their contacts back home. The recruitment process is more peer-to-peer and less traceable, with recruits often traveling through Turkey and modern infrastructure to reach ISIS-controlled regions. The appeal of ISIS crosses various socio-economic and educational backgrounds, and Western recruits have risen to high levels within the ISIS organization. Despite numerous arrests, the lure of ISIS shows no signs of waning.\n",

Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West?  The summary is as follows: After the rise of ISIS, U.S. prosecutions of potential recruits have surged, with at least 25 individuals detained since January 2015. The increased arrests indicate that ongoing, resource-intensive investigations, initiated when ISIS began capturing territory a year prior, are finally nearing completion. ISIS has exploited a media environment that amplifies its propaganda, reaching recruits through fear-inducing videos on platforms like YouTube. Initially, self-radicalized individuals joined, but upon arriving in the self-declared ISIS caliphate, they encouraged friends and contacts back home to join them. This peer-to-peer recruitment has been particularly problematic for intelligence and counterterrorism officials, due to its informal nature and ease of travel via Turkey. Unlike Al Qaeda, ISIS recruits come from a diverse range of backgrounds, with a secular appeal to a better life in the caliphate as contrasted with the corrupt West. Despite the high number of arrests, U.S. authorities do not anticipate the appeal of ISIS waning.\n",

Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West?  The summary is as follows: One year after the rise of ISIS as a significant global threat, U.S. arrests of potential recruits have escalated substantially. This increase in arrests indicates the completion of complex investigations initiated when ISIS seized territories a year ago. ISIS has leveraged the media environment to amplify its propaganda, making it more attractive to potential recruits compared to al Qaeda. The initial recruits were self-radicalized, consuming ISIS propaganda from social media platforms. Once they reached the self-proclaimed ISIS caliphate, they started recruiting their friends and contacts back home to join them. A notable example is the alleged Minnesota cell of recruits linked to American Abdi Nur. The peer-to-peer recruitment strategy employed by ISIS, which operates below the radar, presents a challenge to intelligence and counterterrorism officials. Unlike traditional recruitment methods used by al Qaeda, ISIS adopts a more secular approach, promoting life in the caliphate as superior to the corrupt West, attracting individuals from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds. Despite the numerous arrests, there is no indication that the allure of ISIS is diminishing.\n",

Tokyo (CNN)A Japanese court has issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in the west of the country, citing safety concerns, a court official told CNN. Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kansai Electric Power Company's Takahama nuclear plant. But locals successfully petitioned the court in Fukui Prefecture, where the plant is located, raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake. Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant. Since then, the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy, arguing it is essential to the country's economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports. But opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart. Keith Henry, managing director of Tokyo-based Asia Strategy, which advises businesses on Japanese public policy issues, says the decision will force Abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy. \"That was a body blow [for Abe] because it's no longer a political issue, it's a legal issue. It changes the calculus and the dynamics,\" he said. \"It's now in the courts. And the government is powerless to do anything about it.\" READ MORE: Power company abandons robot stranded inside Fukushima plant .

The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster.

But the court ruled that the new safety standards were \"loose,\" lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said. The power company said it would appeal the decision. \"We deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended, and cannot accept it at all,\" it said in a statement.

Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture's governor, although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court.

Tokyo (CNN)A Japanese court has issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in the west of the country, citing safety concerns, a court official told CNN. Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kansai Electric Power Company's Takahama nuclear plant. But locals successfully petitioned the court in Fukui Prefecture, where the plant is located, raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake. Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant. Since then, the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy, arguing it is essential to the country's economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports. But opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart. Keith Henry, managing director of Tokyo-based Asia Strategy, which advises businesses on Japanese public policy issues, says the decision will force Abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy. \"That was a body blow [for Abe] because it's no longer a political issue, it's a legal issue. It changes the calculus and the dynamics,\" he said. \"It's now in the courts. And the government is powerless to do anything about it.\" READ MORE: Power company abandons robot stranded inside Fukushima plant . Anti-nuclear activists celebrated following the Fukui District Court's decision in their favor Tuesday. The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster. It said in a statement that \"scientific and professional findings\" showed that the safety of the reactors was assured. But the court ruled that the new safety standards were \"loose,\" lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said. The power company said it would appeal the decision. \"We deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended, and cannot accept it at all,\" it said in a statement. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tuesday that the country's nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the \"world's strictest\" safety standards. The government had no intention to change course on its planned nuclear restart, he said. Takahama was one of two nuclear facilities granted approval to resume operations. Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture's governor, although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court. Analyst Henry said the renewable energy sector could benefit from the Takahama decision, as the country weighed solar and hydro power as alternatives. Prior to the Fukushima disaster, about 30% of Japan's energy was nuclear generated. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report from Tokyo.  A Japanese court has issued an injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors at the Takahama nuclear plant, operated by the Kansai Electric Power Company, due to concerns over their safety in the event of a strong earthquake. This comes despite the country's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, granting approval for the reopening of the reactors. Locals had petitioned the court in Fukui Prefecture, where the plant is located, contesting the reactors' ability to withstand a strong earthquake. The government has shown opposition to the court's decision, with the Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, arguing for a return to nuclear energy to reduce utility bills associated with energy imports. However, public opinion polls consistently show opposition to nuclear restarts. The decision is seen as a legal issue that could potentially redefine Japan's energy policy, as it moves towards meeting its energy needs with alternatives such as solar and hydro power.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade. Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms. The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said. \"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"  In rural Indiana's Scott and Jackson counties, a severe HIV outbreak linked to the prescription opioid Opana has grown, with 142 positive cases as of Friday. The outbreak, ongoing since mid-December, is a concern due to the area's limited health resources and a lack of HIV specialists. Education and prevention measures, such as needle exchanges, door-to-door education, and a temporary clinic, are being implemented. The CDC and state health officials attribute the rapid spread of the infection to drug abuse, particularly in isolated rural areas, and the lack of awareness about the dangers of sharing needles. The outbreak has also been linked to prescription drug abuse, which has been a longstanding problem in the region. The situation highlights the need for vigilance to prevent the spread of HIV and other infectious diseases.\n",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an increase in new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county, specifically Scott and Jackson counties, linked to the use of the prescription opioid Opana. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six preliminary positive test results. The CDC, state health leaders, and Indiana University are taking steps to control the outbreak, including offering education, temporary clinics, and door-to-door visits. The outbreak is particularly concerning due to the area's limited healthcare resources and the involvement of a younger population. The CDC emphasizes the importance of education and the implementation of needle exchange programs to reduce new infections. The outbreak also highlights the issue of prescription drug abuse in rural areas along the Ohio River, which has led to increased needle sharing and infection rates. The CDC warns against complacency and emphasizes the need for continued vigilance to prevent further spread of infectious diseases.\n",

(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade. Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms. The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said. \"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"  The summary of the source text is as follows: A severe outbreak of HIV, linked to the use of the prescription opioid Opana, has occurred in rural Scott and Jackson counties, Indiana, resulting in 142 cases as of Friday.

The state of Indiana declared a public health emergency in the county in March and has provided additional resources, including a temporary clinic run by Indiana University and job services. The issue is believed to be linked to the high rate of prescription drug abuse in the area, particularly in isolated rural communities along the Ohio River, where there is a lack of resources and activities for residents. The CDC has expressed concern about the potential spread of HIV and other diseases, such as hepatitis C, among illegal prescription drug users across the country.\n",

The area, with a small population, lacks adequate health resources, with only one infectious disease doctor in Scott County, who is not an HIV specialist. The state has provided additional resources, including a weekly clinic by Indiana University volunteers, door-to-door education about HIV transmission through needle-sharing, and a 30-day needle exchange extension. The drug Opana requires multiple injections per day, increasing the risk of HIV and hepatitis C infection due to more blood exposure and frequent needle-sharing. The CDC emphasizes the need for education to combat the spread of infectious diseases. The HIV outbreak in Indiana serves as a warning for the nation to remain vigilant against the resurgence of infectious diseases.\n",

The difference here is the governing authority's stamp: The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It's one of many official documents relating to matters such as vaccination schedules, fishing methods and rent disputes in the areas now controlled by ISIS. For ISIS sees itself as a government operating under a rule of law, even if the group is most often talked about for its barbaric punishment of anyone who resists or defies its medieval interpretation of that Islamic law. The ISIS documents, some shared with CNN by researcher Aymenn Al-Tamimi, give a window into the bureaucracy of the self-declared caliphate. Last summer, ISIS fighters swept through the Iraqi city of Mosul. Once they took power, leaders wanted to show they could bring stability allowing daily life to resume. So, they quickly reopened the University of Mosul, albeit under a radically altered curriculum. Notices went out that classes would resume on 24 Dhu al-Hijjah 1435 in the Islamic calendar (or October 18, 2014, in the Western calendar), about four months after ISIS overran the city. But some subjects would be banned -- democracy and political thought, also hotel management and tourism and archaeology.

ISIS regards pre-Islamic artifacts as relics from the 'period of ignorance', jahiliyah. Their main concern with archaeology is that it would become a subject turning to idol worship, which is strictly forbidden in Islam. \"Hotel management and tourism may seem strange as first. But there are no hotels under ISIS. They have all been taken over and shut down, either rented out or become places to house families.\" Mosul University still has the same professors and teachers, Al-Tamimi says. \"But now teachers are subjected to Sharia sessions, to learn what is and what is not acceptable to ISIS. So, they have preserved the prior system but within ISIS Sharia law conditions.\" The ISIS Health Department runs hospitals for anyone feeling ill, not just wounded fighters. It has maternity wards, health clinics, even a mobile vaccination unit.

But ISIS is not that primitive,\" says Al-Tamimi. \"This is also reflected in education:  The Taliban, forbids all girls' education. But ISIS allows girls to go to school, albeit in a segregated environment.\" However, education for girls is limited to the age of 15.

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  Washington (CNN)Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say that businesses that provide wedding-related services should be required to provide those services to same-sex couples in the same way they would all other customers, even if they have religious objections. A new CNN/ORC poll finds 57% feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples, while 41% say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons. That's a shift from a Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall, which found just 49% thought businesses ought to be required to serve same-sex couples while 47% that they should be allowed to refuse service on religious grounds. Since the Pew poll last fall, Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in late March by Republican governor Mike Pence, sparked a nationwide controversy over whether the law allowed wedding-related businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples. Apple, Walmart and the NCAA all spoke out against the law, while some states and cities with Democratic leaders barred spending public money in Indiana. Pence and other Indiana legislators insisted discrimination was not the law's intent and a bill to change the original law was signed in early April. In the CNN/ORC Poll, most Democrats (70%) and independents (60%) say wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples as they would different-sex couples, while Republicans break broadly the other way, 67% say religious reasons are a valid justification for refusing service. Full poll results . Looking at Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party, 60% in that group say wedding-related businesses should be allowed to refuse services to same-sex couples, but there are sharp divides within that group by age and ideology. Moderate and liberal Republicans and Republican-leaners broadly say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve all couples the same way (58%) while three-quarters of conservative Republicans favor allowing a caterer or florist to refuse service for religious reasons (74%). Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents under age 50, 56% say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve same-sex and different-sex couples the same way while among those age 50 or older, 72% think they should not be required to do so.

The majority of Americans (57%) believe businesses providing wedding-related services should be required to serve same-sex couples, regardless of religious objections. This represents a shift from a previous poll, with more Americans now in favor of service for same-sex couples. Republicans and conservative Republicans are more likely to support religious exemptions for refusing service, with a significant age divide among Republicans. White evangelicals generally favor allowing businesses to refuse service for religious reasons. These findings come from a CNN/ORC International poll conducted in late April 2015. There have been controversial issues surrounding the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which led to nationwide debates about discrimination towards gay and lesbian couples.\n",

Washington (CNN)Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say that businesses that provide wedding-related services should be required to provide those services to same-sex couples in the same way they would all other customers, even if they have religious objections. A new CNN/ORC poll finds 57% feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples, while 41% say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons. That's a shift from a Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall, which found just 49% thought businesses ought to be required to serve same-sex couples while 47% that they should be allowed to refuse service on religious grounds.

This percentage is an increase from a previous Pew Research Center poll. The shift is significant among Democrats, independents, and younger adults. However, among Republicans and conservative Republicans, a majority believe religious reasons can justify refusing service to same-sex couples. Age differences are more pronounced among Republicans, with older Republicans being more likely to support the refusal of service. The poll also indicates that white evangelicals generally support allowing businesses to refuse service for religious reasons, but this stance is less common among non-evangelical whites.

(CNN)One of Tokyo's most prominent districts has taken a small, but potentially significant step to recognizing same-sex unions in Japan. The government of Shibuya ward, one of the capital's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts, passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for \"partnership certificates\" for same-sex couples, allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. Same-sex partners who are registered with the district's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy, such as joint filing of taxes, are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities. The measure was proposed in February by Shibuya's mayor, Toshitake Kuwahara. While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding, proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward's decision is a step in the right direction. \"It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing,\" Gon Matsunaka, a gay rights activist, told CNN. While Shibuya's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage, the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities. \"What is important for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community in Shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society,\"  Matsunaka said . \"It could be a strong driver for Shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems LGBT people are facing.\" Taiga Ishikawa, Tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in Japan, told CNN the ordinance was a \"big first step for the protection of human rights.\" He called the decision \"happy\" but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles. He said that the most important part of today's announcement is that it \"should be actually put into practice, as should education for understanding (LGBT individuals) especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young.\" Neighboring Setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following Shibuya's lead. However, former councilor Ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement's momentum for granted. \"To realize equal rights for gay couples, a national law has to be made,\" he said. While outright discrimination against the LGBT community is rare in Japan, its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage. Many hide their sexuality from their employers, co-workers, families and friends. But the tide may be turning. A recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4% oppose gay marriage, but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70%. An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which commissioned the poll, welcomed the Shibuya decision, calling it \"a bold and important step forward.\" Only traditional marriages are recognized under Japan's constitution, but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation, according to Mari Miura, a professor of gender and politics at Sophia University in Tokyo. \"The constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage, so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional,\" Miura told Bloomberg Business. While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party \"don't like the idea of same-sex marriage, but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum.\" Conservative groups were vocal in their opposition, with one, known as the Network Pushing for Normalization of Education, telling the Japan Times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other Japanese citizens would degrade the \"familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history.\" While Shibuya's registration system will be a first for Japan, Yodogawa ward in the western Japanese city of Osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the LGBT community. In 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced, and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to LGBT individuals. Journalist Chie Kobayashi contributed reporting from Tokyo .  Tokyo's Shibuya ward passed an ordinance allowing same-sex couples to obtain partnership certificates, offering limited rights akin to married heterosexual couples, such as hospital visitation rights and co-signed tenancy agreements. The measure, proposed by Shibuya's mayor Toshitake Kuwahara, is a step towards promoting marriage equality. While not legally binding, the certificates are seen as progress by advocates of marriage equality in Japan. Shibuya's decision may encourage neighboring Setagaya ward to follow suit. However, a national law is needed to ensure full equality for gay couples in Japan, according to Tokyo councillor Taiga Ishikawa. The move is seen as an important step towards visibility and understanding for the LGBT community.\n",

Summary: Shibuya Ward, a prominent district in Tokyo, has introduced an ordinance that allows for the issuance of partnership certificates to same-sex couples, providing them with limited rights similar to heterosexual married couples. This includes hospital visitation rights and co-signing tenancy agreements. Although the certificates are not legally binding, advocates for marriage equality view this as a progressive step towards recognition and equal rights for the LGBT community in Japan. The measure was proposed by Shibuya's mayor, Toshitake Kuwahara, in February. Other benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples, such as joint tax filing, are controlled by the federal government and are outside the purview of individual municipalities. The move has been welcomed by gay rights activists and local officials, with Taiga Ishikawa, Tokyo Councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in Japan, calling it a \"big first step for the protection of human rights.\" However, it's important to note that the partnership certificates are not a substitute for marriage licenses and their effectiveness relies on their implementation and education about LGBT issues. Neighboring Setagaya ward has indicated interest in following Shibuya's lead, but the need for a national law to secure equal rights for gay couples has been emphasized.

Beijing (CNN)Amid tight security, a Chinese court has convicted veteran journalist Gao Yu for revealing state secrets and sentenced her to seven years in prison. Gao, 71, immediately said she would appeal, her lawyer Mo Shaoping told CNN Friday. After a closed trial last November, the No. 3 Intermediate People's Court in Beijing had twice delayed handing down a verdict, giving Gao's supporters some hope that the authorities' apparent hesitation may lead to her acquittal and release. \"Today's conviction is mainly based on a forced confession that she had since retracted,\" Mo said. \"This is a totally wrong judgment that doesn't respect the facts or the evidence.\" The government had accused Gao of disclosing a highly confidential \"Document No. 9\" issued by the ruling Communist Party leadership in 2013 to an overseas Chinese-language news organization, according to her lawyer. The document revealed the Party's ideological battle plan to counter advocates of constitutional democracy, banning public discussions on topics ranging from press freedom, civil rights to judicial independence. \"There is no defense against state secret charges in China, anything the Party or the government want to label as state secrets will be labeled and treated as such -- they can even do it retroactively,\" said Nicholas Bequelin, the Hong Kong-based East Asia director of Amnesty International. \"Her sentencing is in line with the very stern approach President Xi Jinping's team has taken on dissent, information control and challenges to the Party,\" he added. Beijing police detained Gao in late April of last year -- ahead of the sensitive 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown -- and state broadcaster CCTV soon aired her \"confession\" on national television. Expressing \"deep remorse\" in the video, Gao told interrogators she \"deeply regretted that her behavior had harmed national interests and violated the law.\" Mo, her lawyer, said the authorities had extracted the confession by threatening her son's safety and released the police video to CCTV without her knowledge. He added the alleged recipient of the leaked document even publicly denied that Gao was his source. An outspoken journalist and press freedom advocate, Gao began her career as a reporter for the state-run China News Service in 1979 and, in recent years, had been writing columns for overseas Chinese-language publications. She was arrested after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and released more than a year later. She was imprisoned for another six years for leaking state secrets in 1993 -- though the government has never disclosed details of that case. Since Xi took power over two years ago, his government has jailed hundreds of activists across China despite rising international concern. \"We are in the midst of one of the most severe crackdowns on human rights activists,\" said Bequelin of Amnesty International. \"What the state used to tolerate, it doesn't tolerate anymore.\"  Chinese court has convicted veteran journalist Gao Yu for revealing state secrets and sentenced her to seven years in prison. Gao, a 71-year-old journalist, immediately announced an appeal. The conviction is based on a forced confession, which Gao has since retracted, according to her lawyer. The government accused Gao of disclosing a confidential document revealing the Communist Party's ideological battle plan, issued in 2013. The government's hard stance on dissent, information control, and challenges to the Party has been noted, with hundreds of activists jailed since Xi Jinping took power.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Supported by American intelligence and supplied with advanced U.S.-made weaponry, Saudi jets began airstrikes in Yemen late last month in the name of what the kingdom's Washington ambassador described as \"restoring the legitimate government\" and protecting a \"Yemeni constitution and elections.\" The need to protect constitutions and elections is a rather strange message from the representative of an absolute monarchy. Indeed, Saudi motives in Yemen likely have nothing to do with protecting the country's \"legitimate government,\" its constitution or its electoral process. So what is really going on? The kingdom's real motives seem clear if one looks at Saudi monarchy's history of not allowing regional competition of any kind, while consistently combating efforts to build democratic governments that empower the people. This approach was evident in 2013, when Saudi Arabia voiced its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy in Egypt, which was in keeping with counterrevolutionary Saudi policies that aimed to contain or reverse the results of the Arab Spring. The Saudi goal is simple: Prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self-determination. And the excuse of \"resisting Iran's influence,\" meanwhile, appears to be nothing but sectarian bluster. For example, in 2009, the Houthis (more accurately described as the Ansarullah) were not yet receiving help from Iran, yet for weeks the kingdom pummeled them with airstrikes, following Saudi claims of a Houthi incursion. True, the Ansarullah movement now benefits from Iranian support. But it is far from the only group getting help from outside sources in the region. With all this in mind, the American decision to stand behind the Saudi attack on Yemen can best be described as misguided. Although the Houthi movement's rhetoric is unquestionably anti-American, it has not targeted any American interests. In fact, when the U.S. Embassy packed up in Sanaa in January, leaving a fleet of over 20 armored SUVs behind at the airport, the Houthis reportedly said they would round up the cars and deliver them to a U.N. representative in Yemen. And while the Houthis did not welcome the American presence in Yemen, they did not interfere with U.S. operations against al Qaeda in the country. But one of the biggest miscalculations has been that U.S. policy has adopted the Saudi-Gulf narrative on Yemen, effectively placing Saudi ambitions to control Yemen above previous American priorities like destroying the safe haven for al Qaeda there. Indeed, the Obama administration appears to have abandoned Yemen to Saudi machinations. This reality was underscored when U.S State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki effectively endorsed Saudi bombing, saying the \"Saudis have legitimate concerns about the possible impact of current events in Yemen on their security.\" The implication here seems to be that any country \"concerned\" about its neighbors can go ahead and bomb them, a view that risks creating a dangerous precedent. Back in September, White House spokesman Josh Earnest described Yemen as a success story in the war on terrorism, explaining that the U.S. priority in Yemen was not to establish a \"Jeffersonian democracy\" but to prevent Yemen from becoming a safe-haven for al Qaeda and affiliates. Yet if that policy goal remains in place, then it must be acknowledged that the Saudi war on Yemen will not only undermine the U.S. aim of preventing al Qaeda from making Yemen a safe haven, but also undermine broader U.S. efforts in Yemen. The reality is that Saudi and Gulf Co-operation Council jets are effectively acting as al Qaeda's air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot al Qaeda from several Yemeni regions. Interestingly, while Saudi Arabia deployed about 100 aircraft against the Houthis on the second day of its offensive, it reportedly deployed a mere four fighter jets in the early U.S.-led campaign against ISIS last year. Regardless, the results of the Saudi campaign are unlikely to be positive -- one only need look at the way a much smaller Houthi force than today was able to outfox the Saudi military back in 2009. Back then, Houthi forces consisted of only a few hundred fighters, but they shocked the Saudi army, reportedly capturing Saudi equipment and forcing the evacuation of almost 250 Saudi villages as it seized territory along the border. Today, that ragtag group of Houthi rebels has been replaced by a much larger group called Ansarullah, modeled after Lebanon's Hezbollah. Back in 2009, the rebels were limited to parts of the Saada region and were self-funded, although Yemen claimed they had minor assistance from the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Yet despite this, they were still able to withstand some 90 days of Saudi bombardment. Today, the Ansarullah group is receiving political, financial and military support from Iran. Already, the Saudi government was forced to cancel flights to southern airports, and it has also reportedly suspended classes in schools in the border regions. The situation is only likely to deteriorate as the fighting continues. What should be done now? Saudi interests in Yemen should not replace those of the United States. With this in mind, the Obama administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict, one that can be embraced by the various Yemeni factions. A change in approach is essential not only because the Saudi-led war on Yemen is wrong and destined to fail, but because it might end up further opening the Yemeni door to Iran. But perhaps most importantly, by supporting a self-interested Saudi campaign, the U.S. may actually empower an al Qaeda with the potential still to do great harm to the United States.  The summary of the source text is that Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes in Yemen, citing the need to restore the legitimate government and protect the Yemeni constitution and elections. However, the text suggests that Saudi Arabia's motives are not pure, but rather an attempt to prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self-determination. The text also highlights the Saudi Arabia's history of not allowing regional competition, including their support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy in Egypt in 2013. The text criticizes the American decision to support the Saudi attack on Yemen, arguing that it is misguided and that the Saudi war on Yemen will undermine the U.S. aim of preventing al Qaeda from making Yemen a safe haven, and potentially empower al Qaeda. The text suggests that the Obama administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict in Yemen that can be embraced by the various Yemeni factions.\n",

The summary is as follows: The Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, supported by the U.S. and equipped with American-made weapons, is not primarily aimed at restoring the legitimate government or protecting the constitution and elections, as stated by Saudi officials. Instead, Saudi Arabia's motives are rooted in its history of thwarting regional competition and combating efforts to build democratic governments.

The real goal is to prevent the rise of popularly supported governments in the region that seek self-determination. The U.S.'s decision to back the Saudi attack on Yemen is criticized as misguided, as it places Saudi ambitions to control Yemen above previous American priorities like combating al-Qaeda in the region.

The American decision to support the Saudi attack on Yemen is criticized as misguided, as it risks undermining US aims in Yemen, such as preventing Yemen from becoming a safe haven for al Qaeda. A more political solution to the conflict is suggested, to prevent further opening the Yemeni door to Iran and empowering al Qaeda. The summary also notes that the Saudi campaign's results are unlikely to be positive, as a larger group of Houthi rebels has replaced the ragtag group of 2009, and they have already been able to withstand Saudi bombardment.\n",

Already, the Saudi government was forced to cancel flights to southern airports, and it has also reportedly suspended classes in schools in the border regions. The situation is only likely to deteriorate as the fighting continues. What should be done now? Saudi interests in Yemen should not replace those of the United States. With this in mind, the Obama administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict, one that can be embraced by the various Yemeni factions. A change in approach is essential not only because the Saudi-led war on Yemen is wrong and destined to fail, but because it might end up further opening the Yemeni door to Iran. But perhaps most importantly, by supporting a self-interested Saudi campaign, the U.S. may actually empower an al Qaeda with the potential still to do great harm to the United States.  The summary states that Saudi Arabia, with U.S. support and advanced weaponry, has begun airstrikes in Yemen, citing the protection of the \"legitimate government\" and Yemeni constitution as reasons. However, the text suggests that the kingdom's real motives lie in preventing the rise of democratic governments in the region that empower the people, as demonstrated by its support for the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy in Egypt. The Saudi attack on Yemen, according to the text, risks creating a dangerous precedent, undermining U.S. efforts to prevent al Qaeda from establishing a safe haven in Yemen, and potentially empowering al Qaeda. The text concludes by urging the Obama administration to work towards an immediate political solution to the conflict in Yemen that can be embraced by various factions, as supporting a self-interested Saudi campaign may empower al Qaeda with the potential to do harm to the United States.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be normal in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Supported by American intelligence and supplied with advanced U.S.-made weaponry, Saudi jets began airstrikes in Yemen late last month in the name of what the kingdom's Washington ambassador described as \"restoring the legitimate government\" and protecting a \"Yemeni constitution and elections.\" The need to protect constitutions and elections is a rather strange message from the representative of an absolute monarchy. Indeed, Saudi motives in Yemen likely have nothing to do with protecting the country's \"legitimate government,\" its constitution or its electoral process. So what is really going on? The kingdom's real motives seem clear if one looks at Saudi monarchy's history of not allowing regional competition of any kind, while consistently combating efforts to build democratic governments that empower the people. This approach was evident in 2013, when Saudi Arabia voiced its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy in Egypt, which was in keeping with counterrevolutionary Saudi policies that aimed to contain or reverse the results of the Arab Spring. The Saudi goal is simple: Prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self-determination. And the excuse of \"resisting Iran's influence,\" meanwhile, appears to be nothing but sectarian bluster. For example, in 2009, the Houthis (more accurately described as the Ansarullah) were not yet receiving help from Iran, yet for weeks the kingdom pummeled them with airstrikes, following Saudi claims of a Houthi incursion. True, the Ansarullah movement now benefits from Iranian support. But it is far from the only group getting help from outside sources in the region. With all this in mind, the American decision to stand behind the Saudi attack on Yemen can best be described as misguided. Although the Houthi movement's rhetoric is unquestionably anti-American, it has not targeted any American interests. In fact, when the U.S. Embassy packed up in Sanaa in January, leaving a fleet of over 20 armored SUVs behind at the airport, the Houthis reportedly said they would round up the cars and deliver them to a U.N. representative in Yemen. And while the Houthis did not welcome the American presence in Yemen, they did not interfere with U.S. operations against al Qaeda in the country. But one of the biggest miscalculations has been that U.S. policy has adopted the Saudi-Gulf narrative on Yemen, effectively placing Saudi ambitions to control Yemen above previous American priorities like destroying the safe haven for al Qaeda there. Indeed, the Obama administration appears to have abandoned Yemen to Saudi machinations. This reality was underscored when U.S State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki effectively endorsed Saudi bombing, saying the \"Saudis have legitimate concerns about the possible impact of current events in Yemen on their security.\" The implication here seems to be that any country \"concerned\" about its neighbors can go ahead and bomb them, a view that risks creating a dangerous precedent. Back in September, White House spokesman Josh Earnest described Yemen as a success story in the war on terrorism, explaining that the U.S. priority in Yemen was not to establish a \"Jeffersonian democracy\" but to prevent Yemen from becoming a safe-haven for al Qaeda and affiliates. Yet if that policy goal remains in place, then it must be acknowledged that the Saudi war on Yemen will not only undermine the U.S. aim of preventing al Qaeda from making Yemen a safe haven, but also undermine broader U.S. efforts in Yemen. The reality is that Saudi and Gulf Co-operation Council jets are effectively acting as al Qaeda's air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot al Qaeda from several Yemeni regions. Interestingly, while Saudi Arabia deployed about 100 aircraft against the Houthis on the second day of its offensive, it reportedly deployed a mere four fighter jets in the early U.S.-led campaign against ISIS last year. Regardless, the results of the Saudi campaign are unlikely to be positive -- one only need look at the way a much smaller Houthi force than today was able to outfox the Saudi military back in 2009. Back then, Houthi forces consisted of only a few hundred fighters, but they shocked the Saudi army, reportedly capturing Saudi equipment and forcing the evacuation of almost 250 Saudi villages as it seized territory along the border. Today, that ragtag group of Houthi rebels has been replaced by a much larger group called Ansarullah, modeled after Lebanon's Hezbollah. Back in 2009, the rebels were limited to parts of the Saada region and were self-funded, although Yemen claimed they had minor assistance from the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Yet despite this, they were still able to withstand some 90 days of Saudi bombardment. Today, the Ansarullah group is receiving political, financial and military support from Iran. Already, the Saudi government was forced to cancel flights to southern airports, and it has also reportedly suspended classes in schools in the border regions. The situation is only likely to deteriorate as the fighting continues. What should be done now? Saudi interests in Yemen should not replace those of the United States. With this in mind, the Obama administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict, one that can be embraced by the various Yemeni factions. A change in approach is essential not only because the Saudi-led war on Yemen is wrong and destined to fail, but because it might end up further opening the Yemeni door to Iran. But perhaps most importantly, by supporting a self-interested Saudi campaign, the U.S. may actually empower an al Qaeda with the potential still to do great harm to the United States.  The United States, supported by intelligence and supplying advanced weaponry, is backing Saudi Arabia's air strikes in Yemen under the pretext of restoring the legitimate government. However, the motive behind Saudi involvement appears to be their historical resistance to regional competition and the empowerment of democratic governments. This pattern was evident in Saudi Arabia's support for the military coup in Egypt in 2013 that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy. In Yemen, the real objective is to prevent the rise of any popularly supported government seeking self-determination, with the excuse of resisting Iran's influence merely serving as sectarian bluster. The Saudi bombing of the Houthis, while unquestionably anti-American, has not targeted any American interests, as demonstrated by the Houthis' delivery of American-owned armored SUVs to a U.N. representative in Yemen. Concerns about the Saudi-Gulf narrative on Yemen, which places Saudi ambitions to control Yemen above previous American priorities like countering terrorism, have led to the U.S. effectively abandoning Yemen to Saudi machinations. The ongoing Saudi campaign is unlikely to be positive, as a larger and better-supported Houthi force today may have the potential to outfox the Saudi military, as they did in 2009.

(CNN)The last three defendants prosecuted in the hazing death of Florida A&M drum major Robert Champion were convicted Friday of manslaughter and hazing with the result of death, reported CNN affiliate WFTV. A jury deliberated about 2½ hours before returning guilty verdicts against Benjamin McNamee, 25; Aaron Golson, 22; and Darryl Cearnel, 28. They will be sentenced June 26, according to Orange County, Florida, online court records. Until then, they'll be held in the county jail. Champion, 26, died in November 2011 after a band hazing ritual in which he was beaten aboard a school bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida. The initiation required pledges to run down the center of the bus while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members, band members have said. A medical examiner ruled Champion's death a homicide and said he died within an hour of being beaten. Champion suffered multiple blunt trauma blows, the medical examiner said. A total of 15 defendants were charged originally, but most took plea deals, WFTV reported. Last October, Dante Martin stood trial and was convicted of the same charges. He was sentenced to 77 months in prison.  Three defendants, Benjamin McNamee (25), Aaron Golson (22), and Darryl Cearnel (28), were convicted of manslaughter and hazing resulting in death on Friday. The conviction came in the hazing death of Florida A&M drum major Robert Champion, who died in 2011 after a hazing ritual aboard a school bus in Orlando, Florida.

Lakhvi was charged in Pakistan in 2009, accused of masterminding the November 2008 terror attacks that left more than 160 people dead in Mumbai, India's most populous city. Lakhvi still faces trial in the case. But an anti-terrorism court granted Lakhvi bail last year, a decision the Pakistani government said it would challenge. That challenge lasted until Thursday, when the Lahore High Court ordered his release, CNN affiliate and Pakistani outlet GEO News reported. Lakhvi posted bail totaling 2 million Pakistani rupees (more than $19,000), according to GEO News. India, Pakistan's neighbor and rival, condemned Lakhvi's bail release on Friday. The country contacted Pakistan's foreign secretary to underline \"that this has reinforced the perception that Pakistan has a dual policy on dealing with terrorists, and those who have carried out attacks or are posing a threat to India are being dealt with differently,\" said Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs. The accusation that Pakistan might treat India differently highlights long-running tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, which have fought three wars against each other since their partition at the end of British colonial rule. Pakistan's Foreign Office responded Friday by saying, \"It would not be proper to cast aspersions on Pakistan's commitment to countering terrorism at a time when Pakistan has entered a critical stage of defeating the menace of terrorism.\" The Foreign Office also blamed what it said was India's delay in cooperating in the case, saying it \"weakened the prosecution.\" In the Mumbai attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including luxury hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. India executed the last surviving gunman from the attacks in 2012. Other suspects were all killed during the series of attacks, which went on for three days. More about the Mumbai attacks .

(CNN)He might have just won one of sport's most prestigious events, but it wasn't long before Jordan Spieth's thoughts turned to his autistic sister in the glow of victory. The 21-year-old golfer equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record winning score of 18 under par to realize his childhood ambitions of donning the green jacket on Sunday as he swept through the field to become Masters champion at Augusta. An ice-cool display made him the second-youngest winner -- behind only Woods, who was 155 days younger that year -- and only the fifth man to have led from start to finish over the tournament's four days. \"I miss her a lot, and I wish she could have been here,\" Spieth told CNN's Don Riddell in the aftermath of his triumph as he opened up about younger sibling Ellie, who was not able to attend the tournament. \"But I can't wait to get back to her and maybe let her try on the jacket. \"I'll have to bring her back a present from here. That's what she'll be expecting.\" Amid all the pressure of playing professional golf, Spieth's 14-year-old sister provides him with perspective. \"How has she shaped my upbringing? Well, she's the most special part of our family. She's the funniest part of our family,\" he said. \"I love having her around. She's an incredible sister, my biggest supporter. She is somebody who you can watch and then reflect on the big picture of life and understand that all these frustrations in a day, or in a round of golf, are really secondary. \"We wouldn't have that realization without her.\" At the age of just 14, the prodigy from Texas -- who was named after basketball legend Michael Jordan -- had been clear about what he wanted: his aim was to take the Masters title one day. And he betrayed virtually no sign of nerves throughout his stunningly dominant performance, letting slip only a muttered \"oh dear\" when he marginally sliced a tee shot halfway through the final round. Last year, Spieth lost the lead just before the nine-hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time, beating Phil Mickelson's Masters record of 26 birdies for good measure. \"To sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of Augusta National and the Masters was something I watched slip away last year,\" said Spieth, who described the reality of winning as \"even better\" than his dreams. \"I had a chip on my shoulder (about that). I carried some momentum into this week and it all came together, right at the right time.\" Shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport, Spieth, born in Dallas, added: \"Putting on the jacket, it looks good. It looks good. I'm OK wearing green!\" He couldn't stop grinning as he said that he hoped to be finishing his final Masters appearance in 50 years' time, but added that he would \"still remember what it was like walking up the 18th hole today.\" And as he looked less far ahead, he revealed that he would be staying true to his roots at next year's Champions Dinner. Asked what he would put on the menu for that event, he said: \"It would be some form of Texas BBQ.\" The unassuming Spieth's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self-belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers. In 1985, German tennis player Boris Becker stunned Wimbledon when, at the age of 17, he defeated Kevin Curren to become the event's youngest ever men's champion -- a record that still stands today. Becker said people \"thought I had done something I wasn't supposed to do, something that shouldn't have been possible. But I did it -- and then I did it again at 18, just to make the point.\" American player Michael Chang was 118 days younger than Becker when he won the French Open in 1989, while Swiss star Martina Hingis was just 16 when she triumphed at the 1997 Australian Open. Last year, at the age of only 15, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer when he played in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest and the attention of Europe's top clubs, before he signed for Spanish giant Real Madrid. For them, as for Spieth, perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days. And as he looked at a picture of himself with a golf club in hand, taken at the age of 6 or 7 at his grandparents' home in North Carolina, he reflected on the determination that had put him in the green jacket, referring to another Major winner. \"How about the focus on that swing?\" he asked. \"That's a little John Daly-like there, isn't it?\"  Jordan Spieth, the 21-year-old golf prodigy, equaled Tiger Woods' record of 18 under par at the Masters, becoming the second-youngest winner and the fifth to lead from start to finish. After his triumph, he expressed his longing for his autistic sister, Ellie, who could not attend the tournament. He plans to bring her a gift from Augusta and let her try on the green jacket. Spieth's sister, Ellie, provides him perspective, teaching him to appreciate the bigger picture and realize that golf-related frustrations are insignificant. Since childhood, Spieth had aspired to win the Masters, and his success at Augusta surpassed his dreams. He hopes to celebrate his final Masters appearance in 50 years and plans to serve Texas BBQ at the Champions Dinner next year. Spieth's early achievements resemble other child prodigies such as Boris Becker, Michael Chang, and Martina Hingis. His determination and focus were evident even at a young age, reminiscent of John Daly's swing.\n",

She is somebody who you can watch and then reflect on the big picture of life and understand that all these frustrations in a day, or in a round of golf, are really secondary. \"We wouldn't have that realization without her.\" At the age of just 14, the prodigy from Texas -- who was named after basketball legend Michael Jordan -- had been clear about what he wanted: his aim was to take the Masters title one day. And he betrayed virtually no sign of nerves throughout his stunningly dominant performance, letting slip only a muttered \"oh dear\" when he marginally sliced a tee shot halfway through the final round. Last year, Spieth lost the lead just before the nine-hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time, beating Phil Mickelson's Masters record of 26 birdies for good measure. \"To sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of Augusta National and the Masters was something I watched slip away last year,\" said Spieth, who described the reality of winning as \"even better\" than his dreams. \"I had a chip on my shoulder (about that). I carried some momentum into this week and it all came together, right at the right time.\" Shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport, Spieth, born in Dallas, added: \"Putting on the jacket, it looks good. It looks good. I'm OK wearing green!\" He couldn't stop grinning as he said that he hoped to be finishing his final Masters appearance in 50 years' time, but added that he would \"still remember what it was like walking up the 18th hole today.\" And as he looked less far ahead, he revealed that he would be staying true to his roots at next year's Champions Dinner. Asked what he would put on the menu for that event, he said: \"It would be some form of Texas BBQ.\" The unassuming Spieth's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self-belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers. In 1985, German tennis player Boris Becker stunned Wimbledon when, at the age of 17, he defeated Kevin Curren to become the event's youngest ever men's champion -- a record that still stands today. Becker said people \"thought I had done something I wasn't supposed to do, something that shouldn't have been possible. But I did it -- and then I did it again at 18, just to make the point.\" American player Michael Chang was 118 days younger than Becker when he won the French Open in 1989, while Swiss star Martina Hingis was just 16 when she triumphed at the 1997 Australian Open. Last year, at the age of only 15, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer when he played in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest and the attention of Europe's top clubs, before he signed for Spanish giant Real Madrid. For them, as for Spieth, perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days. And as he looked at a picture of himself with a golf club in hand, taken at the age of 6 or 7 at his grandparents' home in North Carolina, he reflected on the determination that had put him in the green jacket, referring to another Major winner. \"How about the focus on that swing?\" he asked. \"That's a little John Daly-like there, isn't it?\"  In this article, Jordan Spieth, a 21-year-old golfer, emerged as the Masters champion at Augusta, equaling Tiger Woods' 1997 record winning score of 18 under par. Despite the victory, Spieth's thoughts turned to his autistic sister Ellie, who couldn't attend the tournament. He expressed his joy to reunite with her and mentioned plans to bring her a gift from the event. Spieth's sister, Ellie, has been instrumental in providing him with perspective throughout his career. At 14, Spieth had expressed his desire to one day win the Masters, and he delivered an ice-cool performance during the tournament without revealing any signs of nerves. Spieth's triumph brings comparisons to other young talents who achieved success early in their careers, such as Boris Becker in tennis, Michael Chang in tennis, Martina Hingis in tennis, and Martin Odegaard in football.\n",

Nairobi, Kenya  (CNN)Kenya froze dozens of accounts linked to suspected terror supporters after militants massacred 147 people last week at a university in Garissa. The government is tracking the finances of people suspected of ties to Al-Shabaab, the militant group that claimed responsibility for the Thursday attack. So far, the government has frozen 86 accounts, but that number could go up, said Mwenda Njoka, a spokesman for the  Interior Ministry. The government has tracked supporters of the terror group since 2011, and efforts to freeze their assets have gone on since then. It has a list of suspects from various parts of the country, but mostly in Nairobi and Mombasa, he said. Kenyans mourned the victims of the attack Tuesday night at Nairobi's Uhuru Park, where hundreds gathered. Organizers unloaded 147 crosses, some draped with the nation's flag, as candles flickered in the dark. Of the fatalities, 142 were students at the university, and the rest were security forces and campus security. \"I can't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying,\" said Mary Wambui, 32, who lives in Nakuru, hundreds of miles from Garissa. \"They were just children. They were trying to make a better life for themselves. Some were first to go to college in their communities. They died trying to get an education.\" Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber, Kenyans used social media to talk about the lives of the victims. They shared pictures of beaming faces, full of life and energy, in happier days. They talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children's bodies. Some students remain unaccounted for, and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues. Kenyan authorities have not released the names of the victims. Kenyan authorities had prior intelligence that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre awaiting transport, a police source said Monday. The frozen accounts is the latest in a series of actions as the government faced heavy criticism for the siege, which lasted hours. A spokesman for President Uhuru Kenyatta said authorities \"got the job done\" and saved lives. The university had about 800 students. \"With the benefit of hindsight, you can always say things could have been done better,\"  Manoah Esipisu said. Kenya also launched airstrikes Monday targeting Al-Shabaab's training camps in Somalia, according to a military source, who said they were not retaliation for last week's massacre. \"The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011,\"  the source said Monday. Kenya has also offered 20 million Kenyan shillings, or about $215,000, for information on the whereabouts of Mohamed Mohamud, who allegedly organized the attack. Mohamud is a senior Al-Shabaab leader known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, authorities said. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, and its violence has spread to Kenya before. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, leaving 67 people dead. The terror group has intensified attacks in Kenya since the country sent troops to Somalia four years ago to help battle the militants.

Kenya has frozen 86 bank accounts linked to suspected terror supporters following last week's university massacre in Garissa, which resulted in 147 deaths.

The government had prior intelligence of a potential attack on a university in Garissa, but delays in mobilizing the rapid response team led to a protracted siege. Kenya also launched airstrikes on Al-Shabaab's training camps in Somalia, and has offered a reward for information on senior Al-Shabaab leader Mohamed Mohamud, who is believed to have organized the attack. The violence extends beyond Kenya, as Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia and has previously attacked Nairobi, such as in the 2013 Westgate Mall attack.\n",

      "Authorities had prior intelligence of a possible attack on a university in Garissa, but were delayed in responding due to logistical issues. The government is now under heavy criticism for the delayed response. To combat Al-Shabaab, Kenya has launched airstrikes on the group's training camps in Somalia, and is offering a reward for information leading to the capture of senior Al-Shabaab leader Mohamed Mohamud, who allegedly organized the university attack. Al-Shabaab, based in Somalia, has intensified attacks in Kenya since the country sent troops to Somalia four years ago to help battle the militants. Previous attacks include the 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, which left 67 people dead.\n",

(CNN)Mullah Mohammed Omar is \"still the leader\" of the Taliban's self-declared Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. That appears to be the primary message of a biography, just published by the Taliban, of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s. The Taliban's \"Cultural Commission\" released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement's website, ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an April 4, 1996, meeting in Afghanistan's Kandahar province when an assembly of Afghans swore allegiance to Omar. Several Afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of Omar's demise. \"There have been a lot of rumors lately about him. Some people are saying that he is not alive,\" said Sayyed Muhammad Akbar Agha, a former Taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement. \"I think the Taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present,\" Agha told CNN in a telephone interview. Bergen: Why U.S. must stay in Afghanistan past 2016 . The biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of the Afghan's jihadi leadership credentials, at a time when ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has declared himself \"caliph\" of the world's Muslims. \"The Taliban has a huge leadership problem at a critical political moment,\" said Graeme Smith, a Kabul-based analyst for the International Crisis Group. \"Another caliph has announced himself to the world, and the Taliban has been silent. And that is getting noticed by militants across South Asia.\" Omar was famously camera-shy during the Taliban's six-year rule over most of Afghanistan. To this day, there are only a handful of photographs of the one-eyed leader. \"He never was actively involved in any of these propaganda campaigns. No publicity. No interviews. He never used the Internet,\" said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist and expert on Afghanistan who once interviewed Osama bin Laden. Omar then all but disappeared after a U.S.-led bombing campaign routed the Taliban from Kabul in 2001. Washington has offered a $10 million reward for his capture. The Taliban have released written statements purportedly made by the leader-in-hiding. But years without any video or audio recordings of the fugitive have led to growing speculation that Omar may have died. The biography challenges rumors of Omar's death by offering a description of his daily work schedule, which begins with prayers, study of the Quran, and then delivering \"orders in a specific way to his Jihadi commanders.\" The publication also seeks to fill in some of the gaps about the militant's early years, including the detail that his \"preferred weapon of choice\" was the RPG-7, a rocket-propelled grenade. According to the biography, Omar was born in 1960 in a village called Chah-i-Himmat in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. His father, a \"well-known and respected erudite and social figure,\" died only five years later, apparently of natural causes. Omar studied at a religious school, or madrassa, run by his uncle. The rise of the Communist Party in Afghanistan, and the subsequent 1979 Soviet invasion, interrupted the young man's studies and propelled him into the arms of the armed Afghan opposition known as the mujahedeen. For the next decade, Omar commanded rebel groups \"against the invading Russians and their internal communist puppets,\" according to the biography. Along the way, he was wounded a number of times and was blinded in his right eye. In one battle, the biography claims, Omar and a fighter named Mullah Biradar Akhund destroyed four Soviet tanks, even though they were armed with only four RPG rounds. The Taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the U.S., allied with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the Soviet army withdrew in defeat in 1989. Afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the Taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in Kabul collapsed in 1992. The movement of warriors who identified themselves as religious scholars emerged to bring order to a country being ripped apart by rival mujahedeen warlords who battled one another for power. The Taliban biography says that Omar and his compatriots \"launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy\" after an initial meeting in Kandahar in June 1994. Two years later, the Taliban captured Kabul and began imposing its austere interpretation of Islamic law on the rest of the country. While the document denounces the Taliban's post-9/11 overthrow at the hands of a U.S.-backed coalition of rival Afghan fighters, it makes no mention of the Taliban's alliance with bin Laden and al Qaeda. During a decade in exile, the Saudi-born bin Laden continued to release periodic video and audio statements until he was killed by U.S. raid on his hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in 2011. Though Taliban militants have continued to battle the U.S.-backed government across Afghanistan, Omar has not been seen or heard from in years.

The 11-page document describes Omar's daily routine, early life, and military achievements against the Soviets.

The biography also aims to emphasize the Taliban's jihadi leadership credentials amid the emergence of ISIS's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Omar, who was famously camera-shy, was born in 1960, studied at a religious school, and led various rebel groups against the Soviets before disappearing after the U.S.-led bombing campaign in 2001.

(CNN)Former Australia cricket captain and legendary broadcaster Richie Benaud has died at the age of 84. Benaud, whose witty one-liners from the commentary box resonated far beyond Australia's shores, said last year he was being treated for skin cancer. \"After Don Bradman, there has been no Australian player more famous than Richie Benaud,\" Cricket Australia said on its website. \"Benaud stood at the top of the game throughout his rich life, first as a record-breaking leg-spinner and captain, and then as cricket's most famous -- and most impersonated -- broadcaster.\" A veteran of 64 Test matches, Benaud was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. While many regarded his voice as the soundtrack to an Australian summer, Benaud was equally revered by the cricketing public on the other side of the world where he spent more than four decades with the BBC taking the game into millions of British living rooms. But whether you were sitting in Sydney or in South London, there were plenty of \"marvelous\" Richie moments from the box to savor: . \"And Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century.\" \"From our broadcasting box you can't see any grass at all. It is simply a carpet of humanity.\" \"Captaincy is 90% luck and 10% skill. But don't try it without that 10%.\" News of his passing quickly generated a wave of condolences, including from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. \"To most Australians Richie Benaud was cricket. He personified its traditions and its values,\" Abbott said in a written statement Friday. \"While many Australians only know Richard Benaud as the voice of cricket, we should not forget that in his day he was a cricketer with few equals. It was why he was so insightful as a commentator. \"As a player his record has withstood the test of time. He led the Australian side from 1958/59 through to 1963/1964, never losing a series in his 28 Tests as captain. \"As captain, he was first to lead a full Australian tour to India and Pakistan in 1959/60. He was the first cricketer to reach a Test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. \"Given the special place Richie Benaud has in our national life, I have asked that on the day of his funeral flags fly at half-mast. I extend my condolences and the condolences of the Australian people, to his wife Daphne and his family and friends. Current Australian captain Michael Clarke posted an image of Benaud on Instagram with the message: \"What a man. Extremely sad day. You were a lot more then just a cricketer Richie. RIP.\" Clarke's former teammate Shane Warne also took to Instagram to post a touching letter to the late commentator. He wrote: \"Dear Richie, I've known you & Daphne for close to 30 years & to everyone you were a legend on all levels & rightly so too. \"As a cricketer, commentator & as a person, you were the best there's ever been & to top it off, an absolute gentleman... For me it was an honour & a privilege to call you a close friend & mentor, we had so many wonderful times together, talking cricket & in particular, our love & passion of leg spin bowling. \"I will cherish our entertaining dinners & all the fun times we shared over a long period of time. I would also like to thank you & Daphne for all your support & time you made for me as a young cricketer & leg spin bowler trying to make his way as an 18 year old, your tips & advice along the journey meant so much !!! \"Richie, you were loved by everyone, not just the cricket family, you were the godfather of cricket & you will be missed by all... R.I.P my friend.\" Benaud, who was born in 1930 in Penrith, New South Wales, lead Australia into an era of world dominance as a player. But it was after he hung up his spikes that his legendary status was confirmed. Writing in a column in The Australian, cricket writer Gideon Haigh wrote \"television was Benaud's calling, suiting his captain's spontaneity and intuition. \"He was authoritative but not pedantic, dignified but not pompous, and never spoke unless he had something to say.

When he was on air, we always had the TV volume turned up because his comments were so insightful.\" Benaud's passing also drew messages of sympathy on social media from beyond his native Australia. Imran Khan, the former captain of Pakistan and now a leading politician there, tweeted: \"Saddened by the death of Richie Benaud, one of the greatest cricketing brains.\" While Kumar Sangakkara, the current captain of Sri Lanka's Test team, posted: \"So sad to hear about the passing of Richie Benaud. The great voice of cricket is no more. He defined an era with conviction and sincerity.\" British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: \"I grew up listening to Richie Benaud's wonderful cricket commentary. Like all fans of the sport, I will miss him very much.\" CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.  Summary: Richie Benaud, a legendary Australian cricket captain and broadcaster, died at the age of 84. Known for his witty one-liners and commentary that transcended Australian borders, Benaud was diagnosed with skin cancer last year. His impact in the cricketing world was immense, with a career spanning 64 Test matches, induction into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985, and decades spent with the BBC. His voice was often associated with the Australian summer, and he was equally revered in the UK. Benaud led Australia to world dominance as a player and cemented his legendary status as a broadcaster, with his commentary style being considered unparalleled. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and current captain Michael Clarke, among others, expressed condolences. Benaud was remembered for his record as a player, including never losing a series as captain, and his insightful commentary. His impact on the cricket world extended beyond Australia, with messages of sympathy pouring in from former captains Imran Khan and Kumar Sangakkara, and British Prime Minister David Cameron, among others.\n",

Aden, Yemen (CNN)It didn't look like much, but we'd been told it was typical of the kind of craft ferrying the route between Djibouti and Aden. Better, everyone advised, to be low key, even if low key meant faded lights and three water pumps chugging at all times. The wooden vessel was called Mecca — after the holy city. We were told we'd be at the port in Aden by the next morning, but as the hours ticked by it soon became apparent that that was wildly optimistic. Morning came and we were still only halfway there. We'd been given a secure route, charted for us by the Djiboutian Coast Guard. It meant hugging the coastline, trying to stay as much as possible out of the deeper water in the middle of the Gulf of Aden where the world's navies seemed to be squaring off. It was almost double the distance of the direct route. Add to that a strong current -- and stomach-churning seas -- and it felt like we would spend an eternity on board. After our second sunset, we were finally close enough for my phone to ping with a Yemeni welcome message. However, we couldn't risk arriving at night; even getting too close to shore would risk being mistaken for a re-supply vessel and potentially taking a Saudi hit. The captain slowed the boat to a crawl so the remaining miles would stretch until daybreak. Finally, morning came. It was time to go into town to see what life was like for the people of Aden. We weren't really sure what to expect but we did know we couldn't stay for long. From the moment we stepped through the gates of the port, we were met by noise and desperation, shoving and shouting. \"Where are you going?\" \"I'll pay, I'll pay\" \"Are you here to take the Americans?\" I shouted back that we'd return soon. We had just five hours on the ground and we needed to visit the hospital, the shuttered markets, the frontlines. There was so much we needed to see. The crowds clustered around our camera lens, asking \"Why?\" \"Why is this happening?\" \"Why hasn't it stopped?\" It felt like no time had passed before we were told we had to go. The shelling had begun. We'd been hearing pops of sniper fire all day but now we could hear rounds of automatic weapons and they were getting louder. As we arrived back at port, we found we weren't leaving alone. After waiting at port, praying a passing ship would dock, ours had become an unexpected lifeline for some of the families caught in the fighting. The Harbor-Master asked if we could take 60 refugees. It didn't feel like the answer could be anything but yes. What we didn't realize until it was too late was that the refugees were being charged $300  a person: An \"exit fee.\" Those who didn't have the money were pushed back behind the wrought iron gates of the port. Those that did shared our day-and-a-half trip home. As the shores of Djibouti grew closer, you could see the uncertainty begin to take over. Many of them had come from comfortable lives, before the war shattered them. They had left homes that once hummed with air conditioners and televisions. Would the camps have TVs, they asked. No, they wouldn't, I said. What I didn't say was that they'd be lucky to have electricity. But woven amid the uncertainty was the relief of escape. Some of the refugees took over our ship's galley -- the kitchen. They'd found a former chef amongst their number who commandeered the store cupboard, sending out a pick and mix of heaped trays.

Over the last few hours, people had shyly come up to ask if they could borrow our phone to tell their families they were safe. Now a deluge of anxious parents, siblings and partners flooded my ear, asking how it could possibly be that we weren't yet on dry land.

Thousands more are still waiting back in Yemen, hoping they too will reach a safe port.  In this CNN report from Aden, Yemen, a wooden vessel named Mecca is used to transport individuals from Djibouti to Aden. The journey is prolonged due to a secure route that requires staying close to the coastline to avoid deeper waters and potential conflict with naval forces. The travelers are met with chaos and desperation upon arrival in Aden, with crowds inquiring about their purpose and safety. The ship becomes an unintentional lifeline for 60 refugees, whom the Harbor-Master requests to be taken to Djibouti. However, the refugees are charged an \"exit fee\" of $300 per person, leaving those without the funds stranded at the port. The refugees take over the ship's galley and share their food and stories with the crew. After arriving in Djibouti, the refugees are given proper status while they await their futures. The report concludes with a reminder that the fortunate refugees represent a small fraction of the thousands still waiting in Yemen for a safe passage.\n",

What we didn't realize until it was too late was that the refugees were being charged $300  a person: An \"exit fee.\" Those who didn't have the money were pushed back behind the wrought iron gates of the port.

Many of them had come from comfortable lives, before the war shattered them. They had left homes that once hummed with air conditioners and televisions. Would the camps have TVs, they asked. No, they wouldn't, I said. What I didn't say was that they'd be lucky to have electricity. But woven amid the uncertainty was the relief of escape. Some of the refugees took over our ship's galley -- the kitchen. They'd found a former chef amongst their number who commandeered the store cupboard, sending out a pick and mix of heaped trays. We got tuna spaghetti and more Turkish coffee than our cameraman Byron could possibly drink. Because we'd brought refugees back with us, we were asked by the Djibouti Coast Guard to dock in the country's north, in Obok, so they could be given the proper status while they wait to see what happens back home. The immigration officials were -- understandably -- a little bemused by our presence amongst a boatload of people fleeing Yemen, but to their credit they decided the important thing was that these families were now safe. From there Djibouti Port was just a few hours away, hours that stretched into infinity for the families ringing my phone to check that their loved ones had made it into harbor. Over the last few hours, people had shyly come up to ask if they could borrow our phone to tell their families they were safe. Now a deluge of anxious parents, siblings and partners flooded my ear, asking how it could possibly be that we weren't yet on dry land. But eventually we were, and as we watched the Djiboutian officials unload what remained of people's belongings onto shore, it was a reminder that these were the lucky ones. Thousands more are still waiting back in Yemen, hoping they too will reach a safe port.  The text describes a journey from Djibouti to Aden, Yemen, aboard a wooden vessel called Mecca. The journey, indirectly charted by the Djiboutian Coast Guard to avoid deep waters and potential conflict, was challenging due to a strong current and rough seas. Upon arrival in Aden, the travelers were met with chaos and desperation at the port, with people asking about their purpose and whether they were there to take Americans. The travelers had limited time on the ground and visited hospitals, markets, and frontlines. They became an unexpected lifeline for 60 refugees, for whom they were later charged $300 as an \"exit fee.\" The refugees shared the travelers' journey back to Djibouti, with many expressing relief and uncertainty about their new circumstances. The travelers were asked to dock in Obok, Djibouti, where immigration officials processed the refugees and ensured their safety. The text concludes by mentioning that thousands more refugees are still waiting in Yemen, hoping to reach a safe port.\n",

Aden, Yemen (CNN)It didn't look like much, but we'd been told it was typical of the kind of craft ferrying the route between Djibouti and Aden. Better, everyone advised, to be low key, even if low key meant faded lights and three water pumps chugging at all times. The wooden vessel was called Mecca — after the holy city. We were told we'd be at the port in Aden by the next morning, but as the hours ticked by it soon became apparent that that was wildly optimistic. Morning came and we were still only halfway there. We'd been given a secure route, charted for us by the Djiboutian Coast Guard. It meant hugging the coastline, trying to stay as much as possible out of the deeper water in the middle of the Gulf of Aden where the world's navies seemed to be squaring off. It was almost double the distance of the direct route. Add to that a strong current -- and stomach-churning seas -- and it felt like we would spend an eternity on board. After our second sunset, we were finally close enough for my phone to ping with a Yemeni welcome message. However, we couldn't risk arriving at night; even getting too close to shore would risk being mistaken for a re-supply vessel and potentially taking a Saudi hit. The captain slowed the boat to a crawl so the remaining miles would stretch until daybreak. Finally, morning came. It was time to go into town to see what life was like for the people of Aden. We weren't really sure what to expect but we did know we couldn't stay for long. From the moment we stepped through the gates of the port, we were met by noise and desperation, shoving and shouting. \"Where are you going?\" \"I'll pay, I'll pay\" \"Are you here to take the Americans?\" I shouted back that we'd return soon. We had just five hours on the ground and we needed to visit the hospital, the shuttered markets, the frontlines. There was so much we needed to see. The crowds clustered around our camera lens, asking \"Why?\" \"Why is this happening?\" \"Why hasn't it stopped?\" It felt like no time had passed before we were told we had to go. The shelling had begun. We'd been hearing pops of sniper fire all day but now we could hear rounds of automatic weapons and they were getting louder. As we arrived back at port, we found we weren't leaving alone.

(CNN)Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill on Friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. Nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Fallin's office said in a press release. CNN affiliate KFOR says it's never been used in an execution in the United States. \"The person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later. In other words, a humane, quick and painless death,\" said Rep. Mike Christian, one of the bill's authors, according to KFOR. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same \"painless\" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections. \"The hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which Oklahoma has managed its execution process historically,\" he said. Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections. Last year, the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer Clayton Lockett. Fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty. \"Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous,\" Fallin said. \"I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard.\" The governor's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection, followed by nitrogen gas, the electric chair and the firing squad.  Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed a bill allowing nitrogen gas executions as an alternative to lethal injection, which is currently on hold due to US Supreme Court review. The nitrogen method is said to cause quick unconsciousness and death from lack of oxygen, and has not been used in US executions. Supporters claim it ensures a humane, quick, and painless death, but critics argue it mirrors past arguments for lethal injections. The bill comes after Oklahoma faced criticism for a botched execution last year. Fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty, stating it's for heinous crimes, and she wants it performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill lists nitrogen gas as the second execution option, following lethal injection, electric chair, and firing squad.\n",

Holding a sword that had belonged to his father -- a  World War II war hero -- the prince laid down a verbal gauntlet. \"Enough is enough, Mr. Farage. So what I'd like to do, Mr. Farage, is to challenge you to a duel,\" he said. \"I would like us to meet in Hyde Park one morning with our swords and resolve this matter in the way that an 18th century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman would traditionally do. \"Are you up for it Mr. Farage?\" Farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of Britain's general elections on May 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince. \"It is an impressive sword.

Another UKIP politician appeared to back his party leader's chances in a duel, tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two, with the comment: \"This is what Nigel would do to him.\" But there was no word on whether Farage would even accept the prince's less life-threatening back-up challenge. \"Alternatively, if you don't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty, Mr. Farage, we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a TV studio in the run-up to the elections,\" Zylinski suggested. \"I'm up for it, it would be really nice, hopefully you will agree.\" Zylinski posted a separate video on YouTube entitled \"7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,\" in which he pointed to a Times newspaper headline from March reading: \"We need more migrants ... they are the best workers in Britain.\" The headline, he said, applied \"principally\" to the Poles. \"What I cannot accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the Poles.

In a video posted on YouTube, Prince Jan Zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against Poles living in Britain. \"The most idiotic example I've heard of has been Mr. Nigel Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the M40,\" Zylinksi said. Holding a sword that had belonged to his father -- a  World War II war hero -- the prince laid down a verbal gauntlet. \"Enough is enough, Mr. Farage. So what I'd like to do, Mr. Farage, is to challenge you to a duel,\" he said. \"I would like us to meet in Hyde Park one morning with our swords and resolve this matter in the way that an 18th century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman would traditionally do. \"Are you up for it Mr. Farage?\" Farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of Britain's general elections on May 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince. \"It is an impressive sword. I don't have one but I'm sure we could find one if we had to. But I'm not intending to accept the offer,\" a spokesman quoted him as saying. \"I would have thought that a Polish prince with a long Polish lineage would rather agree with me that it's a complete tragedy for Poland that it's lost so many of its brightest and best young people.\" UKIP wants Britain to leave the European Union. It says it would not seek to remain a party to the region's free trade or economic treaties \"while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor, which prevents the UK managing its own borders.\" It has also pledged to cut the country's £9 billion ($12.4B) annual foreign aid budget. Another UKIP politician appeared to back his party leader's chances in a duel, tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two, with the comment: \"This is what Nigel would do to him.\" But there was no word on whether Farage would even accept the prince's less life-threatening back-up challenge. \"Alternatively, if you don't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty, Mr. Farage, we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a TV studio in the run-up to the elections,\" Zylinski suggested. \"I'm up for it, it would be really nice, hopefully you will agree.\" Zylinski posted a separate video on YouTube entitled \"7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,\" in which he pointed to a Times newspaper headline from March reading: \"We need more migrants ... they are the best workers in Britain.\" The headline, he said, applied \"principally\" to the Poles. \"What I cannot accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the Poles. Enough is enough, I say, this has got to stop.\" Zylinski pointed to Polish contributions to Britain including  those made by Polish RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain, what he said was a \"wonderful work ethic\" and easy integration into the community. \"We are often more loyal to Britain than many British people I know,\" he said. \"We are very grateful to be here. We would like you to be grateful too. Please stop knocking the Poles. We love this country we would like British to love us too.\"  A Polish Prince, Jan Zylinski, has challenged British politician Nigel Farage to a duel in London's Hyde Park over his immigration policy. Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), is criticized for blaming immigrants for issues such as traffic jams. Zylinski, holding a sword that belonged to his World War II hero father, has issued a verbal challenge to Farage, suggesting they settle their differences in the 18th century fashion of Polish aristocrats and English gentlemen. Farage has declined the offer but expressed support for Polish immigrants, stating they contribute positively to Britain. Zylinski, in a separate video, highlights the positive aspects of Poles living in Britain and urges a stop to hostility towards them.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)My name is Mark Goodacre, and I am a professor of New Testament and Christian origins in the Department of Religious Studies at Duke University. I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's \"Finding Jesus.\" I also appeared in each episode of the program. Viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the \"Finding Jesus\" Facebook page during the season finale about Mary Magdalene. Below are some of the most interesting, and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article: . Anarie Kennedy: The copy we have of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene comes from the second century, but is it possible that the gospel itself could be older (like first century)? Goodacre: Actually, the copy we saw in the show dates from the fifth century. It is currently located in Berlin, Germany. Although it's our most complete manuscript, it is missing several pages. There are two other fragments of the Gospel of Mary, both in Greek, and both dating from the third century. It is difficult to date the Gospel itself. One of the difficulties is that there are no references to it at all in antiquity. Our best guess is that it was written at some point in the middle to late second century. Gustavo Odría:  Where can we get a good translation of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene? Goodacre: There are several good translations of the Gospel of Mary. One suggestion is Karen King's \"The Gospel of Mary of Magdala: Jesus and the First Woman Apostle.\" That book also has good introduction and discussion materials. One thing that is worth adding is that the Gospel is not actually called \"The Gospel of Mary Magdalene.\" The term \"Magdalene\" does not come at all in the texts we have of the Gospel. The heroine is simply called \"Mary.\" Edward James Reeves: I would like to know what really happened to Mary Magdalene? Where did she go? Who last saw her? Goodacre: This is one of the great mysteries about the character! She is so prominent at the end of each of the canonical Gospels, and the reader is expecting to see more of her and to hear more about her in the rest of the New Testament, but there is nothing. She is not mentioned in Acts of the Apostles, or in Paul's letters, or anywhere else. One possibility is that the early church suppressed her memory and chose not to tell the story of this famous female apostle. But if that is the case, it is surprising that the Gospel writers pay so much attention to her in their Passion and Resurrection narratives. Another possibility, and we touched on this in the episode, is that Mary died not long after the events narrated in the Gospels. Perhaps she was a wealthy, elderly widow? @turnbullteacher: Wouldn't Church Fathers writing in the second century have written if Jesus was married or not? Goodacre: That's a good question. There is actually nothing in second century writers that says that Jesus was married and Clement of Alexandria (died 215 AD) takes for granted that Jesus was not married. When the \"Gospel of Jesus' Wife\" was published in 2012, it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of Jesus being married from as early as the second century, but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery. @anna585858: Do you think Magdalene is a nickname or reference to Mary's hometown? Goodacre: It's a good guess that \"Magdalene\" refers to Magdala, and so her name would refer to her hometown, just as Jesus the \"Nazarene\" is from Nazareth. There are other characters in the New Testament who are identified by their hometowns. For example Simon of Cyrene and Joseph of Arimathea. You are right, though, that it could be a nickname and that it might not have anything to do with Magdala. @AllSaintsRadio: Why was the Gospel of Mary Magdalene left out of the canon of 66 Biblical Books? Goodacre: This is a tough one because it is not clear that it was ever in contention. The Gospel of Mary is not even mentioned in any of the extant lists of early Christian works. But in any case, the book was probably written too late to have had a chance of competing with Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, all of which are written by the end of the first or, at the latest, the beginning of the second century. Further, the Gospel of Mary's theology is different from the theology of what became the four canonical Gospels. @StephanoleDReed: Where is it (said) that Jesus had a wife? Goodacre: There are no ancient texts in which Jesus had a wife. The closest we get to the idea is the Gospel of Philip in which Mary Magdalene is described as Jesus' \"companion,\" one of three women who always \"walked with the Lord.\" The same Gospel says that Jesus used to kiss her often, but we don't know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point! However, the Gospel of Philip is probably too late (late second to mid-third century) to be able to tell us anything reliable about the historical Mary Magdalene. Funding Jesus: Who bankrolled Christ's ministry? I would like to thank everyone for their great questions over the last six weeks. Sorry that fellow on-camera expert Candida Moss and I could not get to all of them. Thanks too for all the encouraging words about \"Finding Jesus.\" We are pleased that so many of you have enjoyed and profited from watching it. If you would like to explore these issues in more detail, perhaps I might recommend my podcast, the NT Pod, which you can find on iTunes or at http://podacre.blogspot.com.  Summary: Professor Mark Goodacre, an expert on the New Testament and Christian origins at Duke University, discusses viewer questions about Mary Magdalene on CNN's \"Finding Jesus.\" The most intriguing questions include the age of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, its translation, the whereabouts of Mary Magdalene after the events in the New Testament, and whether the Church Fathers wrote about Jesus being married. Goodacre explains that the copy of the Gospel seen in the show dates from the fifth century, with fragments dating from the third century. The Gospel is not actually called \"The Gospel of Mary Magdalene\" and its dating is challenging due to the lack of references to it in antiquity. The origin of the name \"Magdalene\" is uncertain, and the Gospel of Mary was likely too late to be included in the canonical Gospels. No ancient texts indicate Jesus had a wife, although the Gospel of Philip does suggest Mary Magdalene was Jesus' companion.\n",

When the \"Gospel of Jesus' Wife\" was published in 2012, it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of Jesus being married from as early as the second century, but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery. @anna585858: Do you think Magdalene is a nickname or reference to Mary's hometown? Goodacre: It's a good guess that \"Magdalene\" refers to Magdala, and so her name would refer to her hometown, just as Jesus the \"Nazarene\" is from Nazareth. There are other characters in the New Testament who are identified by their hometowns. For example Simon of Cyrene and Joseph of Arimathea. You are right, though, that it could be a nickname and that it might not have anything to do with Magdala. @AllSaintsRadio: Why was the Gospel of Mary Magdalene left out of the canon of 66 Biblical Books? Goodacre: This is a tough one because it is not clear that it was ever in contention. The Gospel of Mary is not even mentioned in any of the extant lists of early Christian works. But in any case, the book was probably written too late to have had a chance of competing with Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, all of which are written by the end of the first or, at the latest, the beginning of the second century. Further, the Gospel of Mary's theology is different from the theology of what became the four canonical Gospels. @StephanoleDReed: Where is it (said) that Jesus had a wife? Goodacre: There are no ancient texts in which Jesus had a wife. The closest we get to the idea is the Gospel of Philip in which Mary Magdalene is described as Jesus' \"companion,\" one of three women who always \"walked with the Lord.\" The same Gospel says that Jesus used to kiss her often, but we don't know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point! However, the Gospel of Philip is probably too late (late second to mid-third century) to be able to tell us anything reliable about the historical Mary Magdalene. Funding Jesus: Who bankrolled Christ's ministry? I would like to thank everyone for their great questions over the last six weeks. Sorry that fellow on-camera expert Candida Moss and I could not get to all of them. Thanks too for all the encouraging words about \"Finding Jesus.\" We are pleased that so many of you have enjoyed and profited from watching it. If you would like to explore these issues in more detail, perhaps I might recommend my podcast, the NT Pod, which you can find on iTunes or at http://podacre.blogspot.com.  The summary is based on a CNN article discussing questions from viewers about Mary Magdalene, answered by Professor Mark Goodacre, a New Testament and Christian origins expert. The Gospel of Mary Magdalene, dated to the second century, exists in three fragments, with the most complete one from the fifth century. There are no reliable ancient texts suggesting that Jesus was married. The Gospel of Mary Magdalene was not included in the Bible's canon due to its late creation and different theology from the four canonical Gospels.\n",

      "Additionally, Goodacre addresses the question of whether Jesus was married, stating that there are no ancient texts that confirm Jesus was married. Claims of Jesus being married stem from the Gospel of Philip, a late second to mid-third century text that does not provide reliable information about the historical Mary Magdalene.\n",

(CNN)A 24-year-old man is in custody after he called for an ambulance, only to have French authorities come and discover weapons, ammunition and evidence of his plans to target churches -- an attack that someone in Syria requested, a top prosecutor said Wednesday. The man was identified later as Sid Ahmed Ghlam, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told television broadcaster TF1. Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said Ghlam asked for medical help at his home in Paris' 13th district Sunday morning, claiming he had accidentally injured himself when he mishandled a weapon. But authorities found more than a man with a gunshot wound in his thigh. Molins said Ghlam was someone suspected of killing a 32-year-old woman hours earlier and who then intended to launch a larger-scale terror attack in the near future. \"(He) let them believe that he was the victim,\" French President Francois Hollande said Wednesday. \"But police understood that there was an investigation that needed to be initiated.\" That probe started in earnest when police spotted traces of blood and bags in the suspect's car. Based on this discovery \"and in view of the attitude and suspicious behavior of the individual,\" they looked inside the car and found a loaded Kalashnikov gun, a 9-mm revolver, three cell phones, a laptop, a USB key, a satellite navigation system \"and handwritten documents that contained information on possible targets,\" Molins said. A search inside his home turned up yet more potentially key evidence, including three more Kalashnikovs, three bulletproof vests, police armbands, a camera, some 2,000 euros in cash and \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS,\" according to the prosecutor. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" Hollande said. \"It's not the first time.\" Earlier Ghlam was identified as a computer science student originally from Algeria. According to Molins, he lived in that North African country until 2001, joined his parents in France for the next two years, then went back to Algeria. He got his undergraduate degree in that nation, then returned to France to study electronics. He'd never been convicted of a crime; in fact, the lone accusation against him in August 2013 was later withdrawn. But that didn't mean French authorities didn't know about Ghlam. \"He had been noticed wishing to go to Syria,\" Molins explained. The prosecutor added that authorities found nothing to suggest he was imminent threat, \"but he was under surveillance.\" Law enforcement checked on the man once in 2014 and again this year, Cazeneuve said. The minister said the man planned to head to Syria, a country embroiled in a bloody, years-long civil war that has attracted foreigners wishing to join extremist militant groups like ISIS. There was no indication he ever made it. But, Molins said, computer searches revealed that the man had been communicating with someone in Syria who \"asked him to target a church.\" What church? Authorities didn't disclose that detail on Wednesday, though Molins did say \"this target was confirmed by (the suspect's satellite navigation system) and handwritten documents in his car.\" Paris is home to the famed Notre Dame cathedral and Sacre Coeur basilica, both huge draws for tourists. It's not known if either were in line to be attacked, but Prime Minister Manuel Valls Wednesday visited one of the churches allegedly targeted, which was located in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Assuming Ghlam doesn't walk free anytime soon -- for now, he's in custody awaiting possible charges -- that attack won't happen anytime soon. But authorities say he's already claimed at least one victim. Her name is Aurelie Chatelain. The 32-year-old was found dead Sunday morning sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car in Villejuif, killed by a single bullet that struck her shoulder, went through her body and ended up embedded in the seat. Cazeneuve said Chatelain was the mother of a 5-year-old girl and had come to the region on Saturday to attend a training class. It's not known what connection, if any, she had with the suspect. Nonetheless, Molins said that ballistics, DNA, satellite navigation and other evidence connected him to the death of Chatelain, who Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since January. That's when the massacre at Charlie Hebdo's offices and the siege of a kosher market in Paris took place, prompting French authorities to beef up security measures. \"France, like other countries, is facing a terror threat that is unprecedented in its nature and magnitude,\" Valls said. \"... Terrorists are targeting France to divide us.\" CNN's Jethro Mullen, Andrew Carey, Sandrine Amiel and Ariana Williams contributed to this report.  A 24-year-old man, Sid Ahmed Ghlam, is in custody for planning a church attack in Paris. Ghlam initially called for an ambulance claiming he injured himself accidentally. Authorities found weapons, ammunition, and evidence of his plans to target churches in his possession. He is suspected of killing a 32-year-old woman hours before the discovery. The attack was allegedly requested by someone in Syria. Ghlam is a former computer science student from Algeria who had expressed interest in joining extremist militant groups in Syria but was never convicted of a crime. Authorities found evidence connecting him to the death of Aurelie Chatelain, the first victim of terrorism since January.

(CNN)A freshly fallen tree in the roadway was Jason Warnock's first clue. Warnock was driving through a canyon in Lewiston, Idaho, on Wednesday when he saw the tree, then looked up to see an SUV dangling over the edge of a cliff. The only thing holding the GMC Yukon and its terrified driver from a 30-foot drop was a crumpled chain-link fence, still clinging to the earth above Bryden Canyon Road. \"I seen that guy hanging there and he was trying to beat the window out or the door open and I was like 'Oh man,' 'cause only like five links were hanging there,\" Warnock told KXLY, a CNN affiliate. \"I was like, I gotta do something and no one was doing anything.\" What Warnock did next, captured in a dramatic photo by Lewiston Tribune photographer Barry Kough, made headlines around the world. Warnock dashed from his car and scrambled up a hill to the Yukon and its driver, 23-year-old Matthew Sitko, who appeared to be in shock. \"I got up there and I was like, 'Are you alright man?' He shook his head, yeah. I grabbed my Snap-on multi-tool and it had jagged edges on each end. I hit the window three times and it didn't break.

Warnock told KXLY he didn't want or expect all the attention and would rather be fishing in the mountains than reading about himself.  A tree falling on a road in Lewiston, Idaho, led Jason Warnock to witness an SUV hanging precariously over a cliff. The SUV's driver, Matthew Sitko, was trapped and unable to escape. Warnock bravely climbed up the hill to the vehicle, breaking the window with his multi-tool and helping Sitko out to safety. The incident made headlines worldwide, but Warnock preferred anonymity. He was later identified and praised by the Lewiston Police Department. Sitko was treated for minor injuries.\n",

In a heroic act, Warnock rushed to the scene, climbed the hill, and managed to break the driver-side window of the Yukon. Despite multiple attempts, the window refused to shatter. However, Sitko was finally able to lower it, allowing Warnock to pull him to safety. The dramatic rescue was captured by Lewiston Tribune photographer Barry Kough, whose photo subsequently went viral. In the aftermath, Warnock remained anonymous, having quickly left the scene before anyone could identify him.

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  Bangkok (CNN)Thailand has lifted martial law, replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta. Critics have expressed alarm at the move, with Human Rights Watch's Asia director Brad Adams saying it marked the country's \"deepening descent into dictatorship.\" Martial law was lifted Wednesday when the Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved a request from Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha to proceed. Prayuth -- head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) junta -- immediately invoked Article 44 of the country's interim constitution \"to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability.\" Article 44 states, in wide-ranging terms, that when the head of the junta believes it is necessary in the name of public harmony or to prevent the undermining of national security, then he has the power to act as deemed necessary. According to a statement issued by the NCPO, the new order grants military personnel powers to issue summons and arrest those who commit crimes against the royal family or against national stability, who commit crimes involving war weaponry, or who violate the orders of the NCPO. Designated military personnel were granted powers to seize assets, to block media from reporting or publishing, and to detain suspects up to seven days, the statement said. Unauthorized political gatherings of more than five people were banned, while those who defied NCPO orders could be imprisoned for up to a year, it said. Those who were detained could not leave the country without the approval of the head of the NCPO. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the new security order would allow Prayuth \"to issue orders without administrative, legislative, or judicial oversight or accountability.\" \"Thailand's friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand by the junta leader to replace martial law with a constitutional provision that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers,\" Adams said in a statement. Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher on Thailand, told CNN the move would see Prayuth \"become a strongman with ultimate power in his hands to wield as he wishes.\" \"This is a dangerous indication that the junta is not going to keep its promise to restore democracy and respect for human rights in Thailand,\" he said. Rupert Abbott, deputy director for Asia Pacific at Amnesty International, called in a statement for the NCPO to \"reinstate the rule of law and constitutional protections for human rights which the 2014 coup steamrolled over.\" Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed alarm at the news. \"Normally I would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in Thailand,\" the High Commissioner said. \"But I am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian, which bestows unlimited powers on the current Prime Minister without any judicial oversight at all. This clearly leaves the door wide open to serious violations of fundamental human rights.\" Martial law was imposed shortly before Thailand's military seized power last May, ousting the democratically-elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra after months of sometimes violent street protests. Since then, the NCPO has curbed civil liberties, muzzled the media and rounded up opponents. Amnesty International says that since May, hundreds of people have been arbitrarily held and dozens brought before military courts for engaging in peaceful political gatherings or expression. Thai political scholar and coup opponent Pavin Chachavalpongpun told CNN that the move from martial law to the new security order amounted to \"pouring the same wine into a new bottle.\" \"The junta is trying to reinvent itself, but the substance is still there,\" he said. \"In a word: it's absurd. Everyone knows in Thailand they had to abolish the martial law because of international pressure. \"But Article 44 is a lot worse than the martial law because it gives total power to the NCPO.\" Thailand's military rulers have insisted that such restrictive measures are needed to maintain stability, following a decade of political conflict which has pitted a royalist, middle-class Bangkok elite against Shinawatra's supporters, mostly drawn from the urban working class or the rural north. But Pavin did not believe there was a sufficient threat to national security to justify the new order. \"The notion of national security has been exploited over and over,\" he said. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said it was important that Thai citizens were allowed \"to freely exercise their fundamental rights, including the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\"  Thailand has replaced martial law with a new security order, granting expanded powers to the ruling military junta, sparking criticism from human rights groups and international organizations. Critics argue that the new order, invoked under Article 44 of the interim constitution, provides Prayuth Chan-ocha, head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) junta, with unlimited and unaccountable powers. The order allows military personnel to issue summons, arrest, seize assets, block media, detain suspects, ban unauthorized political gatherings, and imprison those who defy NCPO orders. Critics fear this could further undermine democracy and human rights in Thailand, as the NCPO continues to curb civil liberties and muzzle the media. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed alarm at the news, stating that the new order is \"even more draconian\" than martial law.\n",

Rupert Abbott, deputy director for Asia Pacific at Amnesty International, called in a statement for the NCPO to \"reinstate the rule of law and constitutional protections for human rights which the 2014 coup steamrolled over.\" Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed alarm at the news. \"Normally I would warmly welcome the lifting of martial law -- and indeed strongly advocated for it to be lifted in Thailand,\" the High Commissioner said. \"But I am alarmed at the decision to replace martial law with something even more draconian, which bestows unlimited powers on the current Prime Minister without any judicial oversight at all. This clearly leaves the door wide open to serious violations of fundamental human rights.\" Martial law was imposed shortly before Thailand's military seized power last May, ousting the democratically-elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra after months of sometimes violent street protests. Since then, the NCPO has curbed civil liberties, muzzled the media and rounded up opponents. Amnesty International says that since May, hundreds of people have been arbitrarily held and dozens brought before military courts for engaging in peaceful political gatherings or expression. Thai political scholar and coup opponent Pavin Chachavalpongpun told CNN that the move from martial law to the new security order amounted to \"pouring the same wine into a new bottle.\" \"The junta is trying to reinvent itself, but the substance is still there,\" he said. \"In a word: it's absurd. Everyone knows in Thailand they had to abolish the martial law because of international pressure. \"But Article 44 is a lot worse than the martial law because it gives total power to the NCPO.\" Thailand's military rulers have insisted that such restrictive measures are needed to maintain stability, following a decade of political conflict which has pitted a royalist, middle-class Bangkok elite against Shinawatra's supporters, mostly drawn from the urban working class or the rural north. But Pavin did not believe there was a sufficient threat to national security to justify the new order. \"The notion of national security has been exploited over and over,\" he said. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said it was important that Thai citizens were allowed \"to freely exercise their fundamental rights, including the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\"  Thailand has replaced martial law with a new security order, granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta, sparking concerns about a descent into dictatorship. Critics, including Human Rights Watch, argue that the move allows Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha to issue orders without oversight or accountability. The new order allows military personnel to arrest, detain, seize assets, and block media, and bans unauthorized political gatherings. The United Nations and Amnesty International have expressed alarm, with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights calling the new order \"even more draconian\" than martial law. The move comes after the military seized power last May, ousting the democratically-elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra. Thailand's military rulers insist such restrictive measures are needed to maintain stability, following a decade of political conflict.\n",

Bangkok (CNN)Thailand has lifted martial law, replacing it with it a controversial new security order granting sweeping powers to the ruling military junta. Critics have expressed alarm at the move, with Human Rights Watch's Asia director Brad Adams saying it marked the country's \"deepening descent into dictatorship.\" Martial law was lifted Wednesday when the Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved a request from Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha to proceed. Prayuth -- head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) junta -- immediately invoked Article 44 of the country's interim constitution \"to curb acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability.\" Article 44 states, in wide-ranging terms, that when the head of the junta believes it is necessary in the name of public harmony or to prevent the undermining of national security, then he has the power to act as deemed necessary. According to a statement issued by the NCPO, the new order grants military personnel powers to issue summons and arrest those who commit crimes against the royal family or against national stability, who commit crimes involving war weaponry, or who violate the orders of the NCPO. Designated military personnel were granted powers to seize assets, to block media from reporting or publishing, and to detain suspects up to seven days, the statement said. Unauthorized political gatherings of more than five people were banned, while those who defied NCPO orders could be imprisoned for up to a year, it said. Those who were detained could not leave the country without the approval of the head of the NCPO.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said it was important that Thai citizens were allowed \"to freely exercise their fundamental rights, including the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\"  Thailand has replaced martial law with a new security order, granting extensive powers to the ruling military junta, as criticized by human rights organizations and international bodies. The move, initiated by Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha, has been termed as a deepening descent into dictatorship by Human Rights Watch. Under the new order, military personnel are granted wide-ranging powers, including the ability to issue summons, arrest, seize assets, block media, and detain suspects for up to seven days. The new order also bans unauthorized political gatherings and imposes penalties for defying orders, with suspects potentially facing up to a year in prison and being prohibited from leaving the country without approval. Critics argue that the new order effectively grants unlimited and unaccountable powers to Prayuth, removing any administrative, legislative, or judicial oversight. International bodies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have expressed alarm at the decision, calling it \"even more draconian\" than martial law.\n",

When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. \"We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's,\" Mainzer wrote.  Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai was honored with the naming of an asteroid after her, named 316201 Malala or 2010 ML48, by NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer. The asteroid, located between Mars and Jupiter, is approximately 4 kilometers in diameter, with a dark surface color similar to printer toner. Mainzer named the asteroid to recognize the contributions of women, particularly women of color, and to support Malala's education activism, stating that supporting girls' education is crucial to increasing human potential and solving complex problems.\n",

To do that, they will go to any lengths necessary, including -- they say -- taking on ISIS. \"We all are prepared to go and destroy ISIS totally,\" one Basij commander told CNN. \"If our Imam, our Supreme Leader orders us, we will destroy ISIS.\" The commander says that, so far, the Basij has not been caught up in the fight against the feared Islamic extremists currently waging war in parts of Iraq and Syria. But Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, led by General Qassem Suleimani, is already training, advising and supporting Iraqi Shia militias in their fight against ISIS. Suleimani was accused of involvement in the Shia insurgency against U.S. forces during the Iraq war. Today he is a celebrity to many Iraqis and Iranians. That is symbolic of the gulf that still exists between Iran and the U.S., regardless of any thaw in relations in the wake of the recent agreement on a framework nuclear deal and ongoing talks.

But Iran remains unconvinced. \"If they want to destroy ISIS, it is possible for them to achieve that,\" said Major-General Hassan Firouzabadi, Iran's chief of general staff. \"The U.S. military and intelligence organizations have many ways to strike at ISIS, but we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the U.S. and Britain,\" he said. \"We hope that one day, because of their national interests and the will of their nations, the U.S. and the UK will decide to really fight ISIS.\" In ISIS, Iran and the U.S. share a common enemy, but -- for now at least -- no apparent common strategy.Will Iran-Saudi proxy war erupt?  The Basij, a militia loyal to Iran's religious leaders, is prepared to confront ISIS at the instruction of their Supreme Leader. Although not directly engaged in the fight against ISIS, Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force is training, advising, and supporting Iraqi Shia militias in their battle against ISIS. The U.S., leading the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq, denies any direct coordination with Iran. Iranian officials believe their strategy against ISIS is effective but wish for better cooperation with the U.S., while the U.S. asserts a commitment to \"degrade and ultimately defeat\" ISIS. Despite a common enemy in ISIS, the U.S. and Iran have yet to develop a shared strategy in their conflict. The possibility of a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia remains a concern.\n",

It seems that cost has been the chief barrier. \"It puzzles me when an art work is donated to a community, they accept it, and then get angry and insist you redo the art work at your own expense.\" Poulin wrote in the letter. But the recent media attention to the sculpture seems to have changed his mind. \"I am willing to put my time and money into redoing the Lucy sculpture and feel confident after ten years I can do a much better job,\" Poulin wrote.

The Celoron mayor rejects artist's offer to fix the controversial \"Scary Lucy\" statue, stating that cost has been the main issue in previous discussions. The statue, gifted to the town in 2009, has been criticized for resembling a zombie and has inspired a Facebook campaign to remove it.

Tag your favorite unscripted, unedited, un-perfected moments using #MeForReal and see what others are sharing on Facebook, Twitter and the Daily Share. The Internet is always quick to dish out judgmental opinions, such as the body-hate people showed to singer P!nk after she posted a photo of herself in a black dress she wore to a cancer benefit this past weekend (which, if you ask us, was pretty fantastic, and she looked fabulous in it.) As a woman with a lot of experience singing to her detractors, though, she knew exactly what to say and how to say it. And when it came to keeping her tongue firmly in cheek while she schooled people who had nothing better to do than be totally rude, she owned it. Clearly, it's not troubling P!nk or her hubs, Carey Hart (who, by the way, is quite handsome himself, so clearly he has rad taste). Not only did P!nk's response rally her fans, but they also started sharing their own photos of themselves post-pregnancy and embracing what P!nk tells her daughter is her \"squishiness.\" Postscript for the haters: We think you just racked up MORE fans for P!nk. Now go look in a mirror, and tell us -- are YOU perfect?  HLN's #MeForReal campaign encourages sharing raw, unfiltered moments online, emphasizing the importance of authenticity over perfection. A recent example is singer P!nk, who faced criticism for a photo of herself wearing a black dress at a cancer benefit. However, she gracefully responded, educating critics on self-acceptance, particularly post-pregnancy body positivity. Her response mobilized her fans, who began sharing their own post-pregnancy photos, championing self-love. The campaign aims to challenge judgmental internet users, encouraging self-reflection and acceptance of one's imperfections.\n",

The initiative invites everyone to participate by using the hashtag #MeForReal and sharing unedited, unscripted moments of their lives on Facebook, Twitter, and the Daily Share. In conclusion, #MeForReal promotes authenticity and self-acceptance in the digital age.\n",

(CNN)This week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again — not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it. She sure pushed the envelope. With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to \"rebrand\" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run. We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work. Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing. Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a \"relentlessly, insultingly vapid\" effort of \"demographic box-checking.\" Jon Stewart lampooned it as a \"State Farm commercial gone viral\" and also \"boring as s---.\" Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes. But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think. The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed \"I\" to empathetic \"we.\" While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple. Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008. In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers. Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand. A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it. In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion. But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it. Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe. Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby. The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the \"everyday Americans\" campaign theme. Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain. Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo. It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement. In fact, her logo is all about movement. Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones. I'm here to support you with everything I've got. Let me help you move forward. Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future. Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing. For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a \"T\" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news. Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America. In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front. It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu. There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan. In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask? Fair question. But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go. Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly. Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming \"Morning in America\"? What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through. And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast. That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency. She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day. Otherwise there will be messaging \"schizophrenia,\" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008. In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts.  Hillary Clinton kicked off her presidential campaign this week in an unconventional manner, aiming to rebrand and reframe her image. Her video, logo, and road trip mark the start of a long communications strategy to present a more confident, fresh, and empathetic self. While some critics were scathing about her launch video, her campaign may have been successful in terms of marketing, as it aims to change the way people emotionally perceive Clinton. Her road trip to Iowa and new logo are notable aspects of this rebranding effort, with the logo symbolizing movement and a connection with voters. However, consistent messaging and living up to this empathetic relationship with voters will be crucial for Clinton's success, to avoid the perceived inconsistency that derailed her 2008 campaign.\n",

Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future. Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing. For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a \"T\" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news. Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America. In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front. It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu. There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan. In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask? Fair question. But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go. Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly. Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming \"Morning in America\"? What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through. And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast. That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency. She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day. Otherwise there will be messaging \"schizophrenia,\" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008. In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts.  Hillary Clinton recently unveiled an unconventional campaign launch, aiming to rebrand and reframe herself. Her new video, logo, and road trip were designed to project a more confident, fresher, and empathetic image, with the objective of creating a stronger connection with voters. The video received mixed reactions, with some criticism for being too vapid and formulaic. However, from a marketing perspective, Clinton's launch may have been successful in flipping her message from self-absorbed to empathetic, and establishing a more forward-looking image, reminiscent of successful product launches by Nike and Apple. Clinton's road trip to Iowa and her unscripted visit to Chipotle reinforced her \"everyday Americans\" campaign theme, while her new logo, symbolizing movement, is a bold, iconic expression of the emotional connection she seeks with voters. The consistency in her messaging and living up to this image will be key to her success. The contrast in style between Clinton and Marco Rubio's campaign announcements was also notable, with Clinton displaying confidence and finesse in bucking tradition, while Rubio followed a traditional script. The long-term success of Clinton's reframing will depend on her ability to maintain this image consistently throughout her campaign.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)This week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again — not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it. She sure pushed the envelope. With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to \"rebrand\" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run. We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work. Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing. Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a \"relentlessly, insultingly vapid\" effort of \"demographic box-checking.\" Jon Stewart lampooned it as a \"State Farm commercial gone viral\" and also \"boring as s---.\" Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes. But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think. The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed \"I\" to empathetic \"we.\" While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple. Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008. In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers. Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand. A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it. In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion. But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it. Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe. Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby. The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the \"everyday Americans\" campaign theme. Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain. Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo. It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement. In fact, her logo is all about movement. Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones. I'm here to support you with everything I've got. Let me help you move forward.

Critics have been divided, but her logo and spontaneous actions, like standing in line at Chipotle, are seen as potential successful rebranding and reframing strategies. The comparison with Marco Rubio's traditional announcement amplifies Clinton's contemporary image. Consistency will be crucial for the success of her campaign, ensuring that her humble and empathic persona is maintained across all communication channels.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)The mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, which began 100 years ago Friday, is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century, even though the word \"genocide\" did not exist at the time. The issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional, both for Armenians, who are descended from those killed, and for Turks, the heirs to the Ottomans. For both groups, the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts. Some Armenians feel their nationhood cannot be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged. Some Turks still view the Armenians as having been a threat to the Ottoman Empire in a time of war, and say many people of various ethnicities -- including Turks -- were killed in the chaos of war. In addition, some Turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations. So, what do we know about happened in those fateful days? Here are some answers: . The Ottoman Turks, having recently entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were worried that Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire would offer wartime assistance to Russia. Russia had long coveted control of Constantinople (now Istanbul), which controlled access to the Black Sea -- and therefore access to Russia's only year-round seaports. Many historians agree that the number was about 2 million. However, victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million Armenians living in the Caucasus under Russian rule, some of whom were massacred by Ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through East Armenia and Azerbaijan. By 1914, Ottoman authorities were already portraying Armenians as a threat to the empire's security. Then, on the night of April 23-24, 1915, the authorities in Constantinople, the empire's capital, rounded up about 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. Many of them ended up deported or assassinated. April 24, known as Red Sunday, is commemorated as Genocide Remembrance Day by Armenians around the world. Friday is the 100th anniversary of that day. This is a major point of contention. Estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923, with not all of the victims in the Ottoman Empire. But most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918, made by Ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million. Whether due to killings or forced deportation, the number of Armenians living in Turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922. Almost any way one can imagine. While the  death toll is in dispute, photographs from the era document some mass killings. Some show Ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads, others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt. The victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning, torture, gas, poison, disease and starvation. Children were reported to have been loaded into boats, taken out to sea and thrown overboard. Rape, too, was frequently reported. In addition, according to the website armenian-genocide.org, \"The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly removed from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger.\" No. Genocide was not even a word at the time, much less a legally defined crime. The word \"genocide\" was invented in 1944 by a Polish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin to describe the Nazis' systematic attempt to eradicate Jews from Europe. He formed the word by combining the Greek word for race with the Latin word for killing. Genocide became a crime in 1948, when the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The definition included acts meant \"to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" Armenia, the Vatican, the European Parliament, France, Russia and Canada. Germany is expected to join that group on Friday, the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings. Turkey, the United States, the European Commission, the United Kingdom and the United Nations. A U.N. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985, but current U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declines to use the word. Also, a year ago, on the eve of the 99th anniversary of Red Sunday, then-Turkish Prime Minister (now-President) Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings, which he said had \"inhumane consequences.\" While Turkey vehemently continues to reject the word \"genocide,\" his remarks went further than those of any previous Turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of Armenians.  The text discusses the 100-year anniversary of the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, which is considered by some as the first genocide of the 20th century. The killings, which occurred between 1914 and 1923, resulted in an estimated death toll of between 600,000 and 1.5 million Armenians. The issue of whether to call it a genocide is contentious, as it touches on both national identity and historical facts for both Armenians and Turks. While many countries have recognized the genocide, Turkey still rejects the term. In 2014, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a notable remark offering condolences for the mass killings, although he continued to reject using the term \"genocide.\"\n",

St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands (CNN)Government officials are trying to track down vacationers who stayed at villas in the Virgin Islands who may have been exposed to a deadly pesticide. Local officials said methyl bromide is suspected to have been used improperly several times in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in different parts of the island; even the governor said his condominium complex was fumigated with it in 2013, without his knowledge. Investigators are still trying to piece together exactly what happened at the Sirenusa resort, where a Delaware family's vacation in paradise turned into a nightmare. Theresa Devine and Steve Esmond and their two children fell gravely ill and suffered seizures; two brothers, ages 14 and 16, remain in comas. But this was likely not an isolated incident. Local authorities here tell CNN there is evidence methyl bromide was used at least twice at the gated Sirenusa resort on St. John by the pest control company Terminix. They also say Terminix used the pesticide across the islands on different occasions. Dawn Henry, the commissioner designee of the local Department of Planning and Natural Resources, or DPNR, said that while investigating what happened, the agency found methyl bromide was likely also used last fall at the same Sirenusa resort, as well as in a vacation villa in St. Croix and in two nontourist locations. Methyl bromide is banned from indoor use, and is only approved as an agricultural pesticide. Other pest control companies on the Virgin Islands were found in possession of methyl bromide and officials said they are checking records to see whether it was used improperly. Ken Mapp, the governor of the Virgin Islands, said it was. \"What these companies did or appear to have been doing is clearly a violation of the law and they'll be held accountable for it,\"  Mapp said. He said he learned his own complex was fumigated with methyl bromide in 2013, but said there have been no additional reports of people falling ill. Authorities are trying to track down anyone who has stayed at the affected villas or who might have been exposed. Family slowly recovering from illness after Virgin Islands trip . Terminix issued a statement saying it is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" When CNN visited the Terminix office on St. Thomas, which is corporate-owned, an employee refused to comment, and another employee closed the door. Henry said all canisters of methyl bromide known to exist in the area have been confiscated and will be shipped off-island for destruction as soon as possible. In the meantime, an attorney for Esmond and Devine said the family is still struggling. The two teenage boys remain in comas. Their father has regained consciousness and is slowly getting better. Devine is in better condition and is undergoing occupational therapy. DPNR, the local environmental agency, already had been under scrutiny. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has oversight, designated it \"high risk,\" saying the agency \"does not meet management standards.\" The EPA's inspector general is also investigating. According to the Department of Justice, a former commissioner and two DPNR directors have been sentenced to jail terms since 2008. That year, Dean C. Plaskett  was sentenced to nine years for receiving kickbacks in awarding local government contracts. In 2014, Roberto Tapia, the Justice Department said, pleaded guilty to using his position to engage in illegal drug trafficking while he was head of that same agency. He was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison. In January, Mapp was sworn in and appointed Henry as a new designee to run the department, so it is under a new administration. A spokeswoman for the EPA said the DPNR has been cooperative in this investigation. She added that none of the troubles the agency has had are directly related to pesticide enforcement, but instead general practices. Mapp said the agency's problems have nothing to do with what happened to the Devine and Esmond's family. Instead, he blames the pesticide companies. \"It occurred because someone was cutting corners, thought they could enhance their profit margin and thought they could get away with it, and apparently in my own residence someone had been getting away with it for quite some time,\" Mapp said. Part of the investigation, he said, will be tracking whether the proper paperwork was filled out when the canisters were ordered, or if the pesticide was smuggled in. The Department of Justice is also investigating. \"If they purchased it and on these forms they said their use was for agriculture purposes, which is the only legal way they could use it, and then brought them into the territory and used them in commercial and residential buildings, that's a clear and malice violation of the law,\" Mapp said.  Government officials in the U.S. Virgin Islands are investigating potential misuse of the deadly pesticide methyl bromide, following a family's illness and seizures at a resort. Evidence suggests the pest control company Terminix used the pesticide at least twice at the Sirenusa resort on St. John and across the islands on various occasions.

The local environmental agency, the Department of Planning and Natural Resources, has faced scrutiny in the past due to mismanagement and corruption. The incident has been linked to lax regulations and possible smuggling of the pesticide.

St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands (CNN)Government officials are trying to track down vacationers who stayed at villas in the Virgin Islands who may have been exposed to a deadly pesticide. Local officials said methyl bromide is suspected to have been used improperly several times in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in different parts of the island; even the governor said his condominium complex was fumigated with it in 2013, without his knowledge. Investigators are still trying to piece together exactly what happened at the Sirenusa resort, where a Delaware family's vacation in paradise turned into a nightmare. Theresa Devine and Steve Esmond and their two children fell gravely ill and suffered seizures; two brothers, ages 14 and 16, remain in comas. But this was likely not an isolated incident. Local authorities here tell CNN there is evidence methyl bromide was used at least twice at the gated Sirenusa resort on St. John by the pest control company Terminix. They also say Terminix used the pesticide across the islands on different occasions. Dawn Henry, the commissioner designee of the local Department of Planning and Natural Resources, or DPNR, said that while investigating what happened, the agency found methyl bromide was likely also used last fall at the same Sirenusa resort, as well as in a vacation villa in St. Croix and in two nontourist locations. Methyl bromide is banned from indoor use, and is only approved as an agricultural pesticide. Other pest control companies on the Virgin Islands were found in possession of methyl bromide and officials said they are checking records to see whether it was used improperly. Ken Mapp, the governor of the Virgin Islands, said it was. \"What these companies did or appear to have been doing is clearly a violation of the law and they'll be held accountable for it,\"  Mapp said.

He was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison. In January, Mapp was sworn in and appointed Henry as a new designee to run the department, so it is under a new administration. A spokeswoman for the EPA said the DPNR has been cooperative in this investigation. She added that none of the troubles the agency has had are directly related to pesticide enforcement, but instead general practices. Mapp said the agency's problems have nothing to do with what happened to the Devine and Esmond's family. Instead, he blames the pesticide companies. \"It occurred because someone was cutting corners, thought they could enhance their profit margin and thought they could get away with it, and apparently in my own residence someone had been getting away with it for quite some time,\" Mapp said.

The Department of Justice is also investigating. \"If they purchased it and on these forms they said their use was for agriculture purposes, which is the only legal way they could use it, and then brought them into the territory and used them in commercial and residential buildings, that's a clear and malice violation of the law,\" Mapp said.  The U.S. Virgin Islands is investigating potential misuse of the deadly pesticide, methyl bromide, by a pest control company, Terminix, at various villas and resorts, including the Sirenusa resort on St. John. This investigation was prompted by a Delaware family's vacation turning into a nightmare, with four family members falling gravely ill and suffering seizures, two of whom remain in comas. Local authorities found evidence of methyl bromide use at least twice at the Sirenusa resort, and in additional locations. Methyl bromide is banned from indoor use and is only approved for agricultural purposes.

And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation.

(CNN)Protests are gaining steam in Baltimore after a man died from a devastating injury he allegedly suffered while in police custody. Demonstrators have vowed they'll keep taking to the streets until they get justice. To start, protesters say they're looking for answers about what happened to Freddie Gray, and why. But it seems like the questions in the controversial case just keep growing. Protesters rallied at Baltimore City Hall on Thursday, and another march is planned for Saturday. Here's a look at key issues protesters are asking about: . Police say when Gray saw police on April 12, he started running. Within minutes, they caught up with him and arrested him after finding a knife in his pocket. Protesters have echoed the claims of the Gray family's attorney, who argues that police didn't have any probable cause to pursue him, but chased him for \"running while black.\" Baltimore Police union attorney Michael Davey told reporters Wednesday that officers had every right to chase Gray. \"There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did,\" he said. \"In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop.\" An autopsy says Gray died from a severe spinal cord injury. His family says his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and later died. Police say they spotted Gray, gave chase, caught him, cuffed him and requested a \"wagon\" to transport him in less than four minutes. The transport van left with Gray about 11 minutes afterward, police said, and another 30 minutes passed before \"units request paramedics to the Western District to transport the suspect to an area hospital.\" Protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes, and say it's clear police used too much force when Gray was in their custody. Investigators still haven't said what happened inside the van. Union officials from the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 say something happened inside the vehicle, but they don't know what. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told CNN affiliate WJZ that another prisoner inside the van said he didn't see any harm done to Gray. \"What he has said is that he heard Freddie thrashing about,\" Batts said. \"The driver didn't drive erratically, wasn't slamming on breaks, wasn't turning corners fast or in an irrational way.\" Five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, the Baltimore Police Department said Wednesday. \"They have completely cooperated with the investigation from Day 1,\" Davey told reporters. But details of what the officers said haven't been released yet by authorities. Neither have the officers' personnel records or photos. Police say doing that would violate the law. The lack of details a week and a half after the incident is fueling cries from the public, and the lawmakers who represent them. Protesters say police should be releasing what they know now. Baltimore Police officials say they're being as transparent as they can about the case while their criminal investigation is ongoing. And they say they plan to hand over details from the investigation to the State Attorney's Office next week. Some protesters say the officers should be charged with murder for Gray's death. Officials say an investigation is ongoing, and all  the officers involved have been suspended with pay. At this point, it isn't clear whether any charges will be filed. The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the case. The police union said it's 100% behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob, accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court. \"There is, at this time, no indication of any criminal activity whatsoever,\" the union's statement said, \"but our support will not waiver for any reason.\" Gray's case is getting a lot of attention. But protest organizers say it's emblematic of a broader problem. Some protesters say it's not the only time they've seen police brutality on the streets of their city. Long before they took to the streets to demonstrate over Gray's death, some of them had already been at city hall, voicing their concerns over other cases. \"Right now there's a lot of mistrust. They feel it's us versus them,\" Baltimore City Council President Jack Young said. \"It should not be that way and it needs to be fixed.\" According to the Baltimore Sun, the city has paid more than $5.7 million since 2011 for more than 100 cases involving allegations of police wrongdoing. Police didn't admit fault in any of the cases. The police union said in a statement on Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly. \"Let us be clear, we completely disagree with this policy, as many of these cases are settled without concern for the facts but, rather, to avoid the high cost of defending a potential lawsuit. We believe that these cases should be decided in court where proper time and attention can be given,\" the union said. \"The ease of settlement, and substantial award amount, has led to the unjustified perception of an increase in brutality complaints.\" CNN's Dana Ford, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Suzanne Malveaux, Jake Tapper, Miguel Marquez, Brian Todd, Polo Sandoval, Justin Lear, Jason Carroll and Patrick Cornell contributed to this report.  Baltimore protests continue over the death of Freddie Gray, a man who sustained a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody. Protesters demand answers and justice, questioning why Gray was chased, arrested, and allegedly subjected to excessive force. An autopsy indicates Gray's death was due to his spinal cord injury, but the circumstances surrounding his time in the transport van are unclear. Five of the six officers involved in his arrest have provided statements, but details have yet to be released. Protesters have criticized the police for withholding information and want the officers charged with murder. The case is emblematic of a broader issue of mistrust between citizens and police in Baltimore. Settlements for police wrongdoing cases have raised concerns about the police union's stance and policies. The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the case.\n",

Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told CNN affiliate WJZ that another prisoner inside the van said he didn't see any harm done to Gray. \"What he has said is that he heard Freddie thrashing about,\" Batts said. \"The driver didn't drive erratically, wasn't slamming on breaks, wasn't turning corners fast or in an irrational way.\" Five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, the Baltimore Police Department said Wednesday. \"They have completely cooperated with the investigation from Day 1,\" Davey told reporters.

And they say they plan to hand over details from the investigation to the State Attorney's Office next week. Some protesters say the officers should be charged with murder for Gray's death.

The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the case. The police union said it's 100% behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob, accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court. \"There is, at this time, no indication of any criminal activity whatsoever,\" the union's statement said, \"but our support will not waiver for any reason.\" Gray's case is getting a lot of attention. But protest organizers say it's emblematic of a broader problem. Some protesters say it's not the only time they've seen police brutality on the streets of their city. Long before they took to the streets to demonstrate over Gray's death, some of them had already been at city hall, voicing their concerns over other cases. \"Right now there's a lot of mistrust. They feel it's us versus them,\" Baltimore City Council President Jack Young said. \"It should not be that way and it needs to be fixed.\" According to the Baltimore Sun, the city has paid more than $5.7 million since 2011 for more than 100 cases involving allegations of police wrongdoing. Police didn't admit fault in any of the cases. The police union said in a statement on Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly. \"Let us be clear, we completely disagree with this policy, as many of these cases are settled without concern for the facts but, rather, to avoid the high cost of defending a potential lawsuit. We believe that these cases should be decided in court where proper time and attention can be given,\" the union said. \"The ease of settlement, and substantial award amount, has led to the unjustified perception of an increase in brutality complaints.\" CNN's Dana Ford, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Suzanne Malveaux, Jake Tapper, Miguel Marquez, Brian Todd, Polo Sandoval, Justin Lear, Jason Carroll and Patrick Cornell contributed to this report.  Demonstrations have erupted in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray, who sustained a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody. Protesters, questioning the actions of the police, are demanding answers regarding the circumstances of Gray's arrest and the 30 minutes between his transportation in a van and his arrival at a hospital. Police have stated that officers had the right to chase Gray due to being in a high-crime area, but protesters argue that running while black was the reason for his pursuit. The police union has supported the officers involved in the case, maintaining their innocence, while investigations by both local authorities and the U.S. Justice Department are ongoing. The police union also criticized protesters for calling for charges without knowing the facts of the case. The incident is seen by many as emblematic of a broader problem of police brutality in Baltimore, with the city having paid over $5.7 million in settlements for cases involving allegations of police wrongdoing since 2011.\n",

In Baltimore, protests continue over the death of Freddie Gray, who sustained a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody. Gray's arrest took place on April 12, following a chase instigated by police after they spotted him. Questions surround the circumstances of his arrest, the 30 minutes between his arrest and hospitalization, and the use of force while he was in custody. Protesters demand transparency from the authorities, while the police claim they are being as open as possible given the ongoing investigation. The city has paid millions in settlements for police wrongdoing cases since 2011, yet police admit no fault. Some protesters view this as indicative of a broader mistrust and a larger issue of police brutality in the city. The US Justice Department is also investigating Gray's case. The police union supports the officers involved, comparing protesters to a lynch mob.\n",

Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescue crews and residents in Nepal early Sunday began the desperate search for survivors after a magnitude-7.8 quake near the capital of Kathmandu a day earlier flattened homes, buildings and temples, causing widespread damage across the region and killing more than 1,800 people. Follow the latest coverage of Nepal earthquake . Whole streets and squares in the capital of more than 1 million people were covered in rubble. Stunned residents stared at temples that were once part of their daily lives and now were reduced to nothing. Locals and tourists ferreted through mounds of debris in search of survivors. Cheers rose from the piles when people were found alive -- but mostly bodies turned up. The injured ended up being treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic nine-story Dharahara tower that came crashing down during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest, where the quake caused multiple avalanches. A seemingly endless series of aftershocks continued to roil the area, further traumatizing survivors. Residents huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll of 1,832 is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The loss of life reported so far \"is really based on the information we have from the main cities,\" Lex Kassenberg, Nepal country director for CARE International, told CNN. \"But if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well. The information we received from the field is that 80% of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed.\" The quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years. Residents are used to earthquakes in Nepal, and many thought the start of Saturday's quake was a tremor, until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down. \"The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. \"It is clear that very many lives have been lost.\" An estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the Nepal earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said via Twitter. Thirty out of 75 Nepal districts were affected by the quake. In neighboring Tibet, roads buckled, buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed, China's state media reported, citing local authorities. Separately, at least four Chinese citizens in Nepal -- two workers with a Chinese company, a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed, state media reported, citing the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu. Officials in India confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the Nepal quake. The quake struck at 11:56 a.m. local time (2:11 a.m. ET)  and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu. It occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles, which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake. It was reported by people in the area as having lasted a long time. One person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas. Kathmandu sits in a valley surrounded by the Himalayas. Siobhan Heanue, a reporter with ABC News Australia, told CNN she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake. Several temples collapsed around her, she said. \"It's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life,\" Heanue said, adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe. \"It was utterly terrifying.\" Heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple. They found 12 bodies. \"Unfortunately, that search was not fruitful,\" Heanue said. \"There were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square. This was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake.\" The Dharahara tower, the landmark nine-story structure, was packed with people when it collapsed. Heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of Dharahara. The tower, built in 1832, provided visitors with a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley. Are you in Nepal or have loved ones affected? Please share with us if you are in a safe place. Kanak Masni, a journalist in Kathmandu, told CNN by telephone that this appeared to be \"the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934.\" In that quake, which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were killed. Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, was sitting in a coffee shop in Kathmandu's Thamel district. It appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity, he told CNN. Thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub. \"This region is no stranger to earthquakes,\" he said. \"A lot of people had the same feeling: This is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory... It's basically an unwritten book.\" Outside the coffee shop, Nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six-story building. One woman said children were trapped beneath rubble. \"We ran over and ran around the rubble and couldn't hear anything,\" he said. \"There was no chance that they survived.\" Nearby, another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water, Nybo said. A voice was heard coming from the rubble. \"A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive.\" Two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued, Nybo said. Not far away, lay the bodies of three or four women. \"Who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble?\" he said. The streets of Kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didn't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks. Rob Stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. \"It felt like it went on forever,\" the California resident said. Witnesses: \"People are panicked, running down to street\" Outside, people ran onto the street, with the temblor knocking some off their feet. A huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car. Later, as they walked around the city, an aftershock hit. \"People were screaming and looking around,\" he said. \"There were people clearly shaken, upset, crying.\" Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN that weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage. \"Building codes in Kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years,\" he said. \"Efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but, unfortunately, this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the Kathmandu Valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes.\" Chitra Thapa, 48, a CNN security guard in Atlanta, said he spoke by telephone with relatives in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a city about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital. They were fine and were staying on streets. \"Everybody's in shock,\" he said. \"They never felt an earthquake that big.\" Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water and shelter. The international community must react quickly to save lives -- particularly those of children -- said Devendra Tak, of the aid agency Save the Children. \"With every minute the situation becomes worse,\" he said. Food, clothing and medicine will be urgently required, Tak said. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance to Nepal, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to Nepal, the Embassy said via Twitter. \"To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. \"The United States stands with you during this difficult time.

Residents with scrapes and lacerations were  turned away for those in need of more urgent care. Fast Facts on earthquakes . The U.S. Geological Survey had at first measured the strength at magnitude 7.5 but later upgraded it. A strong aftershock of magnitude 6.6 was recorded a little more than a half-hour afterward, along with nearly three dozen other aftershocks, the USGS reported. The force of the quake was said by people who contacted the USGS to be from \"severe\" to \"violent,\" nearly the highest rating on the intensity scale. Tremors were felt as far as New Delhi, more than 200 miles away in neighboring India. An official said they were felt there at magnitude 5.0. The shaking was rated as \"strong\" to \"severe\" on the USGS ShakeMap. CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported that roads in the area were out. IBN reporter K. Dhiksit looked out his window in Kathmandu and saw the collapsed walls of many buildings. As he watched, an aftershock rattled the street. He heard \"big booming sounds,\" he said, and saw people fleeing into the streets. How are earthquakes measured? Photos of caved-in and toppled buildings appeared on social media. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet, \"We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home & in Nepal.\" Manesh Shrestha reported from Kathmandu. Ray Sanchez wrote and reported from New York. Don Melvin wrote and reported from London. Ben Brumfield wrote and reported from Atlanta.

A magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck near Kathmandu, Nepal on April 25, causing widespread destruction, over 1,800 deaths, and numerous injuries. Buildings, homes, and temples were flattened, streets and squares were covered in rubble, and hospitals were overwhelmed. Aftershocks continue to traumatize survivors, with many huddling in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll is expected to rise, especially in rural areas where 80% of the houses have reportedly been destroyed. The United Nations, United States, and other countries are providing aid and support in the aftermath.\n",

Stunned residents stared at temples that were once part of their daily lives and now were reduced to nothing. Locals and tourists ferreted through mounds of debris in search of survivors. Cheers rose from the piles when people were found alive -- but mostly bodies turned up. The injured ended up being treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic nine-story Dharahara tower that came crashing down during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest, where the quake caused multiple avalanches. A seemingly endless series of aftershocks continued to roil the area, further traumatizing survivors. Residents huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll of 1,832 is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The loss of life reported so far \"is really based on the information we have from the main cities,\" Lex Kassenberg, Nepal country director for CARE International, told CNN. \"But if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well. The information we received from the field is that 80% of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed.\" The quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years. Residents are used to earthquakes in Nepal, and many thought the start of Saturday's quake was a tremor, until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down. \"The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. \"It is clear that very many lives have been lost.\" An estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the Nepal earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said via Twitter. Thirty out of 75 Nepal districts were affected by the quake. In neighboring Tibet, roads buckled, buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed, China's state media reported, citing local authorities. Separately, at least four Chinese citizens in Nepal -- two workers with a Chinese company, a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed, state media reported, citing the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu. Officials in India confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the Nepal quake. The quake struck at 11:56 a.m. local time (2:11 a.m. ET)  and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu. It occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles, which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake. It was reported by people in the area as having lasted a long time. One person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas. Kathmandu sits in a valley surrounded by the Himalayas. Siobhan Heanue, a reporter with ABC News Australia, told CNN she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake. Several temples collapsed around her, she said. \"It's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life,\" Heanue said, adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe. \"It was utterly terrifying.\" Heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple. They found 12 bodies. \"Unfortunately, that search was not fruitful,\" Heanue said. \"There were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square. This was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake.\" The Dharahara tower, the landmark nine-story structure, was packed with people when it collapsed. Heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of Dharahara. The tower, built in 1832, provided visitors with a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley. Are you in Nepal or have loved ones affected? Please share with us if you are in a safe place. Kanak Masni, a journalist in Kathmandu, told CNN by telephone that this appeared to be \"the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934.\" In that quake, which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were killed. Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, was sitting in a coffee shop in Kathmandu's Thamel district. It appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity, he told CNN. Thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub. \"This region is no stranger to earthquakes,\" he said. \"A lot of people had the same feeling: This is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory... It's basically an unwritten book.\" Outside the coffee shop, Nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six-story building. One woman said children were trapped beneath rubble. \"We ran over and ran around the rubble and couldn't hear anything,\" he said. \"There was no chance that they survived.\" Nearby, another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water, Nybo said. A voice was heard coming from the rubble. \"A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive.\" Two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued, Nybo said. Not far away, lay the bodies of three or four women. \"Who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble?\" he said. The streets of Kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didn't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks. Rob Stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. \"It felt like it went on forever,\" the California resident said. Witnesses: \"People are panicked, running down to street\" Outside, people ran onto the street, with the temblor knocking some off their feet. A huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car. Later, as they walked around the city, an aftershock hit. \"People were screaming and looking around,\" he said. \"There were people clearly shaken, upset, crying.\" Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN that weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage. \"Building codes in Kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years,\" he said. \"Efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but, unfortunately, this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the Kathmandu Valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes.\" Chitra Thapa, 48, a CNN security guard in Atlanta, said he spoke by telephone with relatives in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a city about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital. They were fine and were staying on streets. \"Everybody's in shock,\" he said. \"They never felt an earthquake that big.\" Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water and shelter. The international community must react quickly to save lives -- particularly those of children -- said Devendra Tak, of the aid agency Save the Children. \"With every minute the situation becomes worse,\" he said. Food, clothing and medicine will be urgently required, Tak said. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance to Nepal, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to Nepal, the Embassy said via Twitter. \"To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. \"The United States stands with you during this difficult time.

The U.S. Geological Survey had at first measured the strength at magnitude 7.5 but later upgraded it.

The force of the quake was said by people who contacted the USGS to be from \"severe\" to \"violent,\" nearly the highest rating on the intensity scale.

The information we received from the field is that 80% of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed.\" The quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years. Residents are used to earthquakes in Nepal, and many thought the start of Saturday's quake was a tremor, until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down. \"The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. \"It is clear that very many lives have been lost.\" An estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the Nepal earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said via Twitter. Thirty out of 75 Nepal districts were affected by the quake. In neighboring Tibet, roads buckled, buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed, China's state media reported, citing local authorities. Separately, at least four Chinese citizens in Nepal -- two workers with a Chinese company, a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed, state media reported, citing the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu. Officials in India confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the Nepal quake. The quake struck at 11:56 a.m. local time (2:11 a.m. ET)  and was centered less than 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu. It occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles, which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake. It was reported by people in the area as having lasted a long time. One person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas. Kathmandu sits in a valley surrounded by the Himalayas. Siobhan Heanue, a reporter with ABC News Australia, told CNN she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake. Several temples collapsed around her, she said. \"It's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life,\" Heanue said, adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe. \"It was utterly terrifying.\" Heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple. They found 12 bodies. \"Unfortunately, that search was not fruitful,\" Heanue said. \"There were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square. This was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake.\" The Dharahara tower, the landmark nine-story structure, was packed with people when it collapsed. Heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of Dharahara. The tower, built in 1832, provided visitors with a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley. Are you in Nepal or have loved ones affected? Please share with us if you are in a safe place. Kanak Masni, a journalist in Kathmandu, told CNN by telephone that this appeared to be \"the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934.\" In that quake, which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were killed. Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, was sitting in a coffee shop in Kathmandu's Thamel district. It appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity, he told CNN. Thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub. \"This region is no stranger to earthquakes,\" he said. \"A lot of people had the same feeling: This is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory... It's basically an unwritten book.\" Outside the coffee shop, Nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six-story building. One woman said children were trapped beneath rubble. \"We ran over and ran around the rubble and couldn't hear anything,\" he said. \"There was no chance that they survived.\" Nearby, another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water, Nybo said. A voice was heard coming from the rubble. \"A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive.\" Two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued, Nybo said. Not far away, lay the bodies of three or four women. \"Who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble?\" he said. The streets of Kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didn't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks. Rob Stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. \"It felt like it went on forever,\" the California resident said. Witnesses: \"People are panicked, running down to street\" Outside, people ran onto the street, with the temblor knocking some off their feet. A huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car. Later, as they walked around the city, an aftershock hit. \"People were screaming and looking around,\" he said. \"There were people clearly shaken, upset, crying.\" Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN that weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage. \"Building codes in Kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years,\" he said. \"Efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but, unfortunately, this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the Kathmandu Valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes.\" Chitra Thapa, 48, a CNN security guard in Atlanta, said he spoke by telephone with relatives in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a city about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital. They were fine and were staying on streets. \"Everybody's in shock,\" he said. \"They never felt an earthquake that big.\" Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water and shelter. The international community must react quickly to save lives -- particularly those of children -- said Devendra Tak, of the aid agency Save the Children. \"With every minute the situation becomes worse,\" he said. Food, clothing and medicine will be urgently required, Tak said. The U.S. government is providing $1 million in immediate assistance to Nepal, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal said. American disaster response teams are also on their way to Nepal, the Embassy said via Twitter. \"To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. \"The United States stands with you during this difficult time.

The U.S. Geological Survey had at first measured the strength at magnitude 7.5 but later upgraded it.

The force of the quake was said by people who contacted the USGS to be from \"severe\" to \"violent,\" nearly the highest rating on the intensity scale.

Buildings, homes, and temples were flattened, and the historic nine-story Dharahara tower collapsed, killing at least 17 people on Mount Everest. Hospitals in the region are overflowing as the injured seek treatment. Aftershocks continue to traumatize survivors, with the death toll expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. Residents in neighboring countries, including Tibet and India, have also reported casualties. The loss of life is particularly devastating in rural areas, where 80% of houses have been destroyed. The quake was the strongest in the region in over 80 years, and residents are shocked as the extent of the devastation becomes clear. The international community is urged to react quickly to provide aid and save lives, particularly those of children.\n",

One person said he felt as if he were on a ship in rough seas. Kathmandu sits in a valley surrounded by the Himalayas. Siobhan Heanue, a reporter with ABC News Australia, told CNN she was wandering at an ancient temple complex at the moment of the earthquake. Several temples collapsed around her, she said. \"It's not too often you find yourself in a situation where you have to run for your life,\" Heanue said, adding that she sought shelter under the table of a cafe. \"It was utterly terrifying.\" Heanue watched as residents picked through the rubble of a destroyed temple. They found 12 bodies. \"Unfortunately, that search was not fruitful,\" Heanue said. \"There were 12 bodies at least pulled from the rubble in the square. This was just one of several historical temple complexes severely affected by the earthquake.\" The Dharahara tower, the landmark nine-story structure, was packed with people when it collapsed. Heanue said at least 50 bodies were pulled from the ruins of Dharahara. The tower, built in 1832, provided visitors with a panoramic view of the Kathmandu Valley. Are you in Nepal or have loved ones affected? Please share with us if you are in a safe place. Kanak Masni, a journalist in Kathmandu, told CNN by telephone that this appeared to be \"the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934.\" In that quake, which was 8.1 magnitude and centered near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were killed. Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, was sitting in a coffee shop in Kathmandu's Thamel district. It appeared to be a minor tremor at first but gradually gained intensity, he told CNN. Thousands poured onto the streets of the densely populated tourist hub. \"This region is no stranger to earthquakes,\" he said. \"A lot of people had the same feeling: This is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory... It's basically an unwritten book.\" Outside the coffee shop, Nybo said he saw a group of women gather near what had been a six-story building. One woman said children were trapped beneath rubble. \"We ran over and ran around the rubble and couldn't hear anything,\" he said. \"There was no chance that they survived.\" Nearby, another building had come down on an area where locals went to do laundry and collect water, Nybo said. A voice was heard coming from the rubble. \"A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting rebar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive.\" Two bodies were found near the spot where the man was rescued, Nybo said. Not far away, lay the bodies of three or four women. \"Who knows how many other bodies lie beneath the rubble?\" he said. The streets of Kathmandu were packed with thousands of locals and tourists who didn't want to go back to their homes or hotels because of recurring aftershocks. Rob Stiles and his wife had just checked into a hotel in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. \"It felt like it went on forever,\" the California resident said. Witnesses: \"People are panicked, running down to street\" Outside, people ran onto the street, with the temblor knocking some off their feet. A huge section of a brick wall crushed motorcycles and a car. Later, as they walked around the city, an aftershock hit. \"People were screaming and looking around,\" he said. \"There were people clearly shaken, upset, crying.\" Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, told CNN that weak building codes in Nepal contributed to the amount of structural damage. \"Building codes in Kathmandu itself have not been well upheld in recent years,\" he said. \"Efforts have been made over the last few years to strengthen these building codes but, unfortunately, this comes too late for the many thousands of buildings that have gone up across the Kathmandu Valley over the last 20 years that did not adhere to the building codes.\" Chitra Thapa, 48, a CNN security guard in Atlanta, said he spoke by telephone with relatives in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a city about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital. They were fine and were staying on streets. \"Everybody's in shock,\" he said. \"They never felt an earthquake that big.\" Aid agencies expressed concern for the welfare of survivors in the coming days, as overnight temperatures were expected to drop and people were forced to make do without electricity, running water and shelter.

Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescue crews and residents in Nepal early Sunday began the desperate search for survivors after a magnitude-7.8 quake near the capital of Kathmandu a day earlier flattened homes, buildings and temples, causing widespread damage across the region and killing more than 1,800 people. Follow the latest coverage of Nepal earthquake . Whole streets and squares in the capital of more than 1 million people were covered in rubble. Stunned residents stared at temples that were once part of their daily lives and now were reduced to nothing. Locals and tourists ferreted through mounds of debris in search of survivors. Cheers rose from the piles when people were found alive -- but mostly bodies turned up. The injured ended up being treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dozens of bodies were pulled from the historic nine-story Dharahara tower that came crashing down during the quake. At least 17 people were reported killed on Mount Everest, where the quake caused multiple avalanches. A seemingly endless series of aftershocks continued to roil the area, further traumatizing survivors. Residents huddled in the cold rain overnight for safety. The death toll of 1,832 is expected to rise as the full extent of the damage is assessed. The loss of life reported so far \"is really based on the information we have from the main cities,\" Lex Kassenberg, Nepal country director for CARE International, told CNN. \"But if you look at the spread of the earthquake a lot of the rural areas have been hit as well. The information we received from the field is that 80% of the houses in these rural areas have been destroyed.\" The quake was the strongest in the region in more than 80 years. Residents are used to earthquakes in Nepal, and many thought the start of Saturday's quake was a tremor, until the earth kept shaking and buildings crashed down. \"The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement. \"It is clear that very many lives have been lost.\" An estimated 4.6 million people in the region were exposed to tremors from the Nepal earthquake, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said via Twitter. Thirty out of 75 Nepal districts were affected by the quake. In neighboring Tibet, roads buckled, buildings collapsed and at least 13 people were killed, China's state media reported, citing local authorities. Separately, at least four Chinese citizens in Nepal -- two workers with a Chinese company, a tourist and a mountaineer -- have been killed, state media reported, citing the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu. Officials in India confirmed at least 34 deaths in three states from the Nepal quake.

In an update Monday from \"champagnepapi\" himself on Instagram, the rapper clarified his reaction: \"Don't misinterpret my shock!! I got to make out with the queen Madonna and I feel 100 about that forever. Thank you @Madonna.\" After the kiss, though, he seemed dazed. \"Oh, s***. What the f*** just happened?\" he asked moments later from the stage. It all went down after Drake performed  \"Madonna,\" a song named for the megastar off his new mixtape \"If You're Reading This It's Too Late,\" according to Billboard. He welcomed Madonna onstage as a special guest to perform a few songs. While wrapping up \"Human Nature,\" the Material Girl, 56, planted one on the seated Drake, 28, who began to flail his arms after a while in an apparent attempt to escape. His sour face after the encounter led many to speculate that he didn't enjoy the kiss. Of course, Drake and Madonna's little makeout sesh got the web talking and meme-ing: . \"So @Drake proves that kissing @Madonna is about as ghastly as I always imagined it would be,\" wrote former CNN personality Piers Morgan. \"Grandma: give Nana some suga . Drake: no no noooooo!!!\" wrote another Tweeter.  In the report by CNN, Madonna is highlighted for her penchant for sharing passionate on-stage kisses with fellow performers. Notable instances include her lip-locking with Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, and more recently, with rapper Drake. During the Coachella music festival in California, Madonna surprised Drake with an unexpected kiss onstage while he was performing a song named after her. The kiss, which was met with apparent reluctance from Drake, left him visibly dazed and confused, causing him to ask from the stage, \"Oh, s***. What the f*** just happened?\" Following the incident, Drake took to Instagram to express his gratitude, stating, \"Don't misinterpret my shock!! I got to make out with the queen Madonna and I feel 100 about that forever. Thank you @Madonna.\" Social media responses to the kiss were varied, with some finding it amusing, while others compared it to unwelcome advances from a grandparent. Former CNN personality Piers Morgan described the encounter as \"ghastly,\" and another Twitter user humorously commented, \"Grandma: give Nana some suga . Drake: no no noooooo!!!\" Overall, the on-stage kiss between Madonna and Drake ignited a wave of conversation and meme creation across the web.\n",

      "In an unprecedented act of religious violence, 15 Muslim migrants, originating from the Ivory Coast, Mali, and Senegal, allegedly murdered 12 Christian migrants during a boat journey from Libya to Italy. The incident occurred on Tuesday during a journey across the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in the deaths of individuals from Nigeria and Ghana. According to Italian police, the alleged assailants targeted the 12 Christians on the boat because of their faith, sparing the lives of other passengers who protested the drowning attempt and formed a human chain. The boat was intercepted by an Italian navy vessel, and the passengers were transferred to a Panamanian-flagged ship, which docked in Palermo, Sicily, leading to the arrests of the 15 suspects. This tragedy underscores the ongoing perilous journey undertaken by thousands of migrants each year, seeking refuge from war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Despite the risks, more than 10,000 people have arrived on Italian shores from Libya since last weekend alone, with many losing their lives during the journey. The International Organization for Migration estimates that approximately 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean since 2000, and the latest boat sinking was reported on Thursday.\n",

(CNN)It's not going to be enough to slake the thirst of the elusive Mars bunny, but scientists say new research seems to support the theory that what looks like a bone-dry red planet during the day could be dotted with tiny puddles of salty water at night. Experts have long thought that a particular kind of salt detected in Martian soil could pull water vapor from the the planet's thin atmosphere into the soil at night and then keep it from freezing despite the extreme cold. Researchers aren't saying they've seen direct evidence of brine hiding out in the Martian night. But they say the new study -- based on a full year of monitoring of temperature and humidity conditions by the Mars Curiosity rover in Gale Crater -- does seem to bear the theory out. \"Gale Crater is one of the least likely places on Mars to have conditions for brines to form, compared to sites at higher latitudes or with more shading,\" said Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona at Tucson, a co-author of the new report.

(CNN)Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in connection with the church's long-running sex abuse scandal, the Vatican announced Tuesday. Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse. The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity. Finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he'd also faced. He was put on two years' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine, according to the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Two charges against his diocese were dropped. At the time of his conviction, Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV: \"I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused.\" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said the conviction and penalty, which included starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse, would have positive ramifications. \"We can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities,\" Baker said. The case against Finn revolved around his diocese's dealings with Shawn Ratigan, an Independence, Missouri, priest who pleaded guilty in August 2012 to five child pornography charges. Church officials found disturbing images on Ratigan's computer but didn't notify police until nearly five months later, prosecutors said. In those interceding months, the priest kept on working. And Finn kept his job as bishop, even after his 2012 conviction. The official website of the Catholic diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph still listed him as its bishop Tuesday morning. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who took over the abuse-shaken Boston archdiocese and has become one of the Pope's point men in the United States, has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who wouldn't be allowed to teach Sunday school was still running an American diocese. \"It's a question that the Holy See needs to address urgently,\" O'Malley said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview in November. \"There's a recognition of that ... from Pope Francis.\" Candida Moss -- a professor at Notre Dame, a Catholic university in Indiana -- said it \"doesn't look very urgent\" that a decision came down only now, nearly three years after the conviction and five months after O'Malley's comments. Several factors may have played a role in the delay, including views from lawyers or power players at the Vatican, who may be reluctant to cast blame at high-level officials who don't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities. But the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after Francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in Chile, Juan Barros, despite protesters' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there. \"It kind of shook Francis' reputation,\" said Moss. \"Having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this, especially in the U.S., I think this is a typical Francis way to reinstall confidence.\" Now that the case has been addressed, the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese has a new leader: Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann. Under the Pope's directive, Naumann will be the Kansas City diocese's apostolic administrator, in addition to his regular responsibilities in Kansas, until a permanent bishop is appointed, according to an announcement on the diocese's website. \"I pray that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the Diocese,\" Naumann said in an open letter to parishioners. \"All of us, who are privileged to serve in leadership for the Church, do so for only a season. It is not our Church, but Christ's Church.\" Moss, the Notre Dame professor, predicted that the shuffling at the western Missouri diocese will be \"very well received,\" though some may question why it took so long. \"It's not just that it's late,\" Moss said, \"but it's that Francis could have been more explicit.\" To that point, the co-director of BishopAccountability.org asked for more elaboration than the Vatican's one-line announcement that Francis accepted the resignation \"in accordance with ... Canon Law.\" Anne Doyle, from the watchdog group that documents the Catholic church's abuse crisis, called Finn's removal \"a good step but just the beginning.\" \"The pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice -- that it signals a new era in bishop accountability,\" Doyle said. \"... What no pope has done to date is publicly confirm that he removed a culpable bishop because of his failure to make children's safety his first priority. We urge Pope Francis to issue such a statement immediately.\" CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.  Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who was convicted in 2012 for failure to report suspected child abuse. Finn served in the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, where he was implicated in the church's sex abuse scandal. The resignation follows years of controversy surrounding Finn's handling of cases, such as that of Shawn Ratigan, a priest who pleaded guilty to child pornography charges. Finn's removal is seen as a step towards addressing the church's historical issues with sex abuse scandals.

Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who was convicted in 2012 for failure to report suspected child abuse within the Catholic Church. Finn served as the Bishop of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph for years after his conviction. The conviction was related to the Diocese's handling of Shawn Ratigan, a Missouri priest who pleaded guilty to child pornography charges. Finn, who initially expressed regret for the events, remained in his position as bishop despite the conviction. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, one of the Pope's point men in the U.S., had previously criticized the inconsistency of having someone convicted for failure to report abuse still holding a bishop position. The resignation comes weeks after Pope Francis faced criticism for the installation of a new bishop in Chile amid protesters' claims of complicity in sexual abuse cases. The Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph now has a new leader, Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann, who will serve as the diocese's apostolic administrator until a permanent bishop is appointed. Anne Doyle from BishopAccountability.org called Finn's removal a good step but emphasized that the Pope should make a statement confirming that he removed a culpable bishop because of his failure to prioritize child safety.\n",

(CNN)Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in connection with the church's long-running sex abuse scandal, the Vatican announced Tuesday. Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse. The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity. Finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he'd also faced. He was put on two years' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine, according to the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Two charges against his diocese were dropped. At the time of his conviction, Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV: \"I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused.\" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said the conviction and penalty, which included starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse, would have positive ramifications. \"We can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities,\" Baker said. The case against Finn revolved around his diocese's dealings with Shawn Ratigan, an Independence, Missouri, priest who pleaded guilty in August 2012 to five child pornography charges. Church officials found disturbing images on Ratigan's computer but didn't notify police until nearly five months later, prosecutors said. In those interceding months, the priest kept on working. And Finn kept his job as bishop, even after his 2012 conviction. The official website of the Catholic diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph still listed him as its bishop Tuesday morning. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who took over the abuse-shaken Boston archdiocese and has become one of the Pope's point men in the United States, has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who wouldn't be allowed to teach Sunday school was still running an American diocese. \"It's a question that the Holy See needs to address urgently,\" O'Malley said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview in November. \"There's a recognition of that ... from Pope Francis.\" Candida Moss -- a professor at Notre Dame, a Catholic university in Indiana -- said it \"doesn't look very urgent\" that a decision came down only now, nearly three years after the conviction and five months after O'Malley's comments. Several factors may have played a role in the delay, including views from lawyers or power players at the Vatican, who may be reluctant to cast blame at high-level officials who don't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities. But the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after Francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in Chile, Juan Barros, despite protesters' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there. \"It kind of shook Francis' reputation,\" said Moss. \"Having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this, especially in the U.S., I think this is a typical Francis way to reinstall confidence.\" Now that the case has been addressed, the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese has a new leader: Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann.

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)On July 20, 2012, excited moviegoers gathered for a midnight screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" at the Century Aurora 16 Multiplex Theater in Aurora, Colorado. Eighteen minutes into the show, and shortly after midnight, a gunman opened fire on the audience. Twelve people were killed and 70 were injured. On Monday, shooting suspect James Holmes goes on trial for 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. It's a moment the survivors and those who lost loved ones have waited for anxiously. It's a moment that will be a painful next step toward healing and one that will no doubt bring back a flood of painful memories. Ahead of the trial, CNN spoke with several people whose lives were changed because of the shooting. They will attend at least part of the trial. Pierce O'Farrill made a last-minute decision to go to the movies with a friend. O'Farrill was shot multiple times and collapsed as he tried to escape. The shooter stood above him, and O'Farrill prepared to die. Then, the gunman moved in another direction. O'Farrill soon saw an officer who told him he was going to make it. Kaylan Bailey attended the movie with her cousin, Jamison, his girlfriend, Ashley, and their daughter, Veronica. Kaylan, just 13 at the time, babysat 6-year-old Veronica often. She had watched her earlier in the day when Ashley, who was pregnant, had an appointment for an ultrasound. When she heard gunfire, Kaylan made a heartrending 911 call. Ashley, Jamison and Veronica had all been shot. Veronica was the youngest to die in the theater. Ashley was paralyzed and later suffered a miscarriage because of the trauma she suffered. Jamison was shot in the head and survived. Tom and Caren Teves lost their son, Alex, who was in the theater with his girlfriend. When the shooting began, Alex shielded his girlfriend, saving her life and absorbing the bullets that would take his. The Teveses remember Alex as someone who was fearless, funny and gave the greatest hugs. \"The world had a great person taken out of it that could've done so much more,\" Caren Teves said. The Teveses launched a campaign called \"No Notoriety\" to challenge the media to not show photos or use the name of the shooter. Marcus Weaver was at the movies with his friend, Rebecca Wingo. As the gunman opened fire, Marcus and Rebecca dropped to the ground. During a break in the gunshots, Marcus tried to get to the exit, taking Rebecca, who was unconscious, with him. The shots started again and it was chaos. Marcus had been hit in the shoulder with buckshot, but he made it to an exit. Rebecca didn't make it out alive. Weaver remembers her as a bright and shining person with a contagious smile. Here, in their own words, is a glimpse at what these people are experiencing 2½ years after the shooting and as the trial begins. O'Farrill: \"I don't think the shooting has defined me as a person. But I think what I've learned from it, the strength that I've gained from overcoming something this terrible, has become a defining factor of my life.\" Bailey: \"I would say that the theater shooting is life-changing, but I don't think it defines me.\" Caren Teves: \"The ripple effect from this whole tragedy is just endless. It goes on and on and on.\" Tom Teves: \"People start to shy away from you, too. Because it's just too painful. And they're afraid of the fact that you're a window into the fact that evil exists. Because you're proof that evil exists, not in your persona but in what happened to your child.\" Weaver:  \"And so as you ask about life, how I see it, I just see it in a different lens. And it took a while to get used to that lens. Because I couldn't do the same thing I did before. I just wasn't that person anymore. I rarely go out to restaurants and stuff. Because, you know, people come up to you and start talking about it. ... \"I don't think anybody who was in that theater that night will ever be the same.\" O'Farrill: \"We woke up today, we got out of bed; this was the day that the Lord promised us. But he certainly hasn't promised us that ... we'll live to see another one. So for me, just living in gratitude and being grateful for every moment I get has been key to my healing.\" Caren Teves: \"It doesn't get any easier. You just learn to fake it better. ... You get stronger carrying the weight.\" Weaver: \"... just like my arm's going to heal, so will I. And we'll all move past this. And we'll get stronger. \" O'Farrill: \"I do hope to meet him someday. It's something that's been on my heart since the shooting happened. And I hope to meet him and just tell him in person, 'Look, you know, you tried to kill me but I don't hate you, and I forgive you. And there's only one way that's possible and that's through Jesus.'\" Bailey: \"No, I don't forgive him. He took so many people's lives, and he hurt so many other people that weren't even in the theater. He hurt families and friends and just everybody in Aurora, honestly.\" Caren Teves: \"As far as forgiveness goes -- normally, I will forgive someone who asks for forgiveness. In this case, I haven't had anyone ask for forgiveness.\" Tom Teves: \"God will forgive anyone who asks for forgiveness. But that also means that you have to stand up and take responsibility for your actions.\" Weaver: \"There's no doubt about it. I forgive him. I really don't even think about him that much at this point ... I just didn't want to carry that bag of rocks on my back anymore.\" O'Farrill: \"The trial starting, I think, will kind of stir things up. And it's been something I've really been trying to prepare myself for, you know. Talking to my counselor about it and praying on it daily, and understanding that, again, I can't control how it all unfolds, you know. But I can be prepared for it.\" Bailey: \"I've never been involved in something so serious. I don't think it's hit me. I don't think I realize what I'm going into.\" Tom Teves: \"It doesn't bring these emotions to the surface again for us. These emotions never leave for us.\" Weaver: \"You start thinking about being on that stand. You start thinking about seeing the shooter right there. You start thinking about -- just all kinds of things and what's it going to be like. And it just races in your head, if you let it, you know? So part of the coping skills is you just don't let it. Go do something different. Go exercise. Go hang out with your wife.\" O'Farrill: \"Whatever punishment James Holmes receives is not going to be part of my closure. I certainly understand that other folks are looking forward to that and that's their path. But we all have different paths to healing.\" Bailey: \"So, like, I don't think that if he does get the death penalty, then, I'll, I don't know how to word this. I won't be happy because that's another person's life. But I think he deserves it.\" Caren Teaves: \"The only justice, for me ... is if that thing was in an urn on my dresser, and Alex was sitting next to us on this couch. That's the only justice.\" Weaver: \"Although I'm not a death penalty person, if the death penalty was ever warranted in any case, it's this case.\"  On July 20, 2012, a mass shooting occurred at the Century Aurora 16 Multiplex Theater during a screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" resulting in twelve deaths and 70 injuries.

(CNN)On July 20, 2012, excited moviegoers gathered for a midnight screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" at the Century Aurora 16 Multiplex Theater in Aurora, Colorado. Eighteen minutes into the show, and shortly after midnight, a gunman opened fire on the audience. Twelve people were killed and 70 were injured. On Monday, shooting suspect James Holmes goes on trial for 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. It's a moment the survivors and those who lost loved ones have waited for anxiously. It's a moment that will be a painful next step toward healing and one that will no doubt bring back a flood of painful memories. Ahead of the trial, CNN spoke with several people whose lives were changed because of the shooting. They will attend at least part of the trial. Pierce O'Farrill made a last-minute decision to go to the movies with a friend. O'Farrill was shot multiple times and collapsed as he tried to escape. The shooter stood above him, and O'Farrill prepared to die. Then, the gunman moved in another direction. O'Farrill soon saw an officer who told him he was going to make it. Kaylan Bailey attended the movie with her cousin, Jamison, his girlfriend, Ashley, and their daughter, Veronica. Kaylan, just 13 at the time, babysat 6-year-old Veronica often. She had watched her earlier in the day when Ashley, who was pregnant, had an appointment for an ultrasound. When she heard gunfire, Kaylan made a heartrending 911 call. Ashley, Jamison and Veronica had all been shot. Veronica was the youngest to die in the theater. Ashley was paralyzed and later suffered a miscarriage because of the trauma she suffered. Jamison was shot in the head and survived. Tom and Caren Teves lost their son, Alex, who was in the theater with his girlfriend. When the shooting began, Alex shielded his girlfriend, saving her life and absorbing the bullets that would take his. The Teveses remember Alex as someone who was fearless, funny and gave the greatest hugs. \"The world had a great person taken out of it that could've done so much more,\" Caren Teves said. The Teveses launched a campaign called \"No Notoriety\" to challenge the media to not show photos or use the name of the shooter. Marcus Weaver was at the movies with his friend, Rebecca Wingo. As the gunman opened fire, Marcus and Rebecca dropped to the ground. During a break in the gunshots, Marcus tried to get to the exit, taking Rebecca, who was unconscious, with him. The shots started again and it was chaos. Marcus had been hit in the shoulder with buckshot, but he made it to an exit. Rebecca didn't make it out alive. Weaver remembers her as a bright and shining person with a contagious smile. Here, in their own words, is a glimpse at what these people are experiencing 2½ years after the shooting and as the trial begins. O'Farrill: \"I don't think the shooting has defined me as a person. But I think what I've learned from it, the strength that I've gained from overcoming something this terrible, has become a defining factor of my life.\" Bailey: \"I would say that the theater shooting is life-changing, but I don't think it defines me.\" Caren Teves: \"The ripple effect from this whole tragedy is just endless. It goes on and on and on.\" Tom Teves: \"People start to shy away from you, too. Because it's just too painful. And they're afraid of the fact that you're a window into the fact that evil exists. Because you're proof that evil exists, not in your persona but in what happened to your child.\" Weaver:  \"And so as you ask about life, how I see it, I just see it in a different lens. And it took a while to get used to that lens. Because I couldn't do the same thing I did before. I just wasn't that person anymore. I rarely go out to restaurants and stuff. Because, you know, people come up to you and start talking about it. ... \"I don't think anybody who was in that theater that night will ever be the same.\" O'Farrill: \"We woke up today, we got out of bed; this was the day that the Lord promised us. But he certainly hasn't promised us that ... we'll live to see another one. So for me, just living in gratitude and being grateful for every moment I get has been key to my healing.\" Caren Teves: \"It doesn't get any easier. You just learn to fake it better. ... You get stronger carrying the weight.\" Weaver: \"... just like my arm's going to heal, so will I. And we'll all move past this. And we'll get stronger. \" O'Farrill: \"I do hope to meet him someday. It's something that's been on my heart since the shooting happened. And I hope to meet him and just tell him in person, 'Look, you know, you tried to kill me but I don't hate you, and I forgive you. And there's only one way that's possible and that's through Jesus.'\" Bailey: \"No, I don't forgive him. He took so many people's lives, and he hurt so many other people that weren't even in the theater. He hurt families and friends and just everybody in Aurora, honestly.\" Caren Teves: \"As far as forgiveness goes -- normally, I will forgive someone who asks for forgiveness. In this case, I haven't had anyone ask for forgiveness.\" Tom Teves: \"God will forgive anyone who asks for forgiveness. But that also means that you have to stand up and take responsibility for your actions.\" Weaver: \"There's no doubt about it. I forgive him. I really don't even think about him that much at this point ... I just didn't want to carry that bag of rocks on my back anymore.\" O'Farrill: \"The trial starting, I think, will kind of stir things up. And it's been something I've really been trying to prepare myself for, you know. Talking to my counselor about it and praying on it daily, and understanding that, again, I can't control how it all unfolds, you know. But I can be prepared for it.\" Bailey: \"I've never been involved in something so serious. I don't think it's hit me. I don't think I realize what I'm going into.\" Tom Teves: \"It doesn't bring these emotions to the surface again for us. These emotions never leave for us.\" Weaver: \"You start thinking about being on that stand. You start thinking about seeing the shooter right there. You start thinking about -- just all kinds of things and what's it going to be like. And it just races in your head, if you let it, you know? So part of the coping skills is you just don't let it. Go do something different. Go exercise. Go hang out with your wife.\" O'Farrill: \"Whatever punishment James Holmes receives is not going to be part of my closure. I certainly understand that other folks are looking forward to that and that's their path. But we all have different paths to healing.\" Bailey: \"So, like, I don't think that if he does get the death penalty, then, I'll, I don't know how to word this. I won't be happy because that's another person's life. But I think he deserves it.\" Caren Teaves: \"The only justice, for me ... is if that thing was in an urn on my dresser, and Alex was sitting next to us on this couch. That's the only justice.\" Weaver: \"Although I'm not a death penalty person, if the death penalty was ever warranted in any case, it's this case.\"  The summary of the CNN article discusses the upcoming trial for James Holmes, who is accused of killing 12 and injuring 70 in a shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado during a midnight screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in 2012.

While some offer forgiveness towards the shooter, others do not, expressing feelings of anger and a desire for justice. Overall, the article highlights the profound impact the shooting has had on the lives of those affected, and the ongoing journey towards healing and closure.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be normal in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)On July 20, 2012, excited moviegoers gathered for a midnight screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" at the Century Aurora 16 Multiplex Theater in Aurora, Colorado. Eighteen minutes into the show, and shortly after midnight, a gunman opened fire on the audience. Twelve people were killed and 70 were injured. On Monday, shooting suspect James Holmes goes on trial for 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. It's a moment the survivors and those who lost loved ones have waited for anxiously. It's a moment that will be a painful next step toward healing and one that will no doubt bring back a flood of painful memories. Ahead of the trial, CNN spoke with several people whose lives were changed because of the shooting. They will attend at least part of the trial. Pierce O'Farrill made a last-minute decision to go to the movies with a friend. O'Farrill was shot multiple times and collapsed as he tried to escape. The shooter stood above him, and O'Farrill prepared to die. Then, the gunman moved in another direction. O'Farrill soon saw an officer who told him he was going to make it. Kaylan Bailey attended the movie with her cousin, Jamison, his girlfriend, Ashley, and their daughter, Veronica. Kaylan, just 13 at the time, babysat 6-year-old Veronica often. She had watched her earlier in the day when Ashley, who was pregnant, had an appointment for an ultrasound. When she heard gunfire, Kaylan made a heartrending 911 call. Ashley, Jamison and Veronica had all been shot. Veronica was the youngest to die in the theater. Ashley was paralyzed and later suffered a miscarriage because of the trauma she suffered. Jamison was shot in the head and survived. Tom and Caren Teves lost their son, Alex, who was in the theater with his girlfriend. When the shooting began, Alex shielded his girlfriend, saving her life and absorbing the bullets that would take his. The Teveses remember Alex as someone who was fearless, funny and gave the greatest hugs. \"The world had a great person taken out of it that could've done so much more,\" Caren Teves said. The Teveses launched a campaign called \"No Notoriety\" to challenge the media to not show photos or use the name of the shooter. Marcus Weaver was at the movies with his friend, Rebecca Wingo. As the gunman opened fire, Marcus and Rebecca dropped to the ground. During a break in the gunshots, Marcus tried to get to the exit, taking Rebecca, who was unconscious, with him. The shots started again and it was chaos. Marcus had been hit in the shoulder with buckshot, but he made it to an exit. Rebecca didn't make it out alive. Weaver remembers her as a bright and shining person with a contagious smile. Here, in their own words, is a glimpse at what these people are experiencing 2½ years after the shooting and as the trial begins. O'Farrill: \"I don't think the shooting has defined me as a person. But I think what I've learned from it, the strength that I've gained from overcoming something this terrible, has become a defining factor of my life.\" Bailey: \"I would say that the theater shooting is life-changing, but I don't think it defines me.\" Caren Teves: \"The ripple effect from this whole tragedy is just endless. It goes on and on and on.\" Tom Teves: \"People start to shy away from you, too. Because it's just too painful. And they're afraid of the fact that you're a window into the fact that evil exists. Because you're proof that evil exists, not in your persona but in what happened to your child.\" Weaver:  \"And so as you ask about life, how I see it, I just see it in a different lens. And it took a while to get used to that lens. Because I couldn't do the same thing I did before. I just wasn't that person anymore. I rarely go out to restaurants and stuff. Because, you know, people come up to you and start talking about it. ... \"I don't think anybody who was in that theater that night will ever be the same.\" O'Farrill: \"We woke up today, we got out of bed; this was the day that the Lord promised us. But he certainly hasn't promised us that ... we'll live to see another one. So for me, just living in gratitude and being grateful for every moment I get has been key to my healing.\" Caren Teves: \"It doesn't get any easier. You just learn to fake it better. ... You get stronger carrying the weight.\" Weaver: \"... just like my arm's going to heal, so will I. And we'll all move past this. And we'll get stronger. \" O'Farrill: \"I do hope to meet him someday. It's something that's been on my heart since the shooting happened. And I hope to meet him and just tell him in person, 'Look, you know, you tried to kill me but I don't hate you, and I forgive you. And there's only one way that's possible and that's through Jesus.'\" Bailey: \"No, I don't forgive him. He took so many people's lives, and he hurt so many other people that weren't even in the theater. He hurt families and friends and just everybody in Aurora, honestly.\" Caren Teves: \"As far as forgiveness goes -- normally, I will forgive someone who asks for forgiveness. In this case, I haven't had anyone ask for forgiveness.\" Tom Teves: \"God will forgive anyone who asks for forgiveness. But that also means that you have to stand up and take responsibility for your actions.\" Weaver: \"There's no doubt about it. I forgive him. I really don't even think about him that much at this point ... I just didn't want to carry that bag of rocks on my back anymore.\" O'Farrill: \"The trial starting, I think, will kind of stir things up. And it's been something I've really been trying to prepare myself for, you know. Talking to my counselor about it and praying on it daily, and understanding that, again, I can't control how it all unfolds, you know. But I can be prepared for it.\" Bailey: \"I've never been involved in something so serious. I don't think it's hit me. I don't think I realize what I'm going into.\" Tom Teves: \"It doesn't bring these emotions to the surface again for us.

In 2015, shooting suspect James Holmes goes on trial for 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. Survivors and victims' families attend the trial, which is a significant step toward healing but may bring back painful memories. Several people affected by the shooting shared their experiences and reflections ahead of the trial. Pierce O'Farrill was shot multiple times and prepared to die but survived. Kaylan Bailey, a 13-year-old babysitter, made a distressing 911 call after her cousin and her cousin's family were shot. The Teves family lost their son Alex, who shielded his girlfriend during the shooting. Marcus Weaver lost his friend Rebecca Wingo in the shooting. The victims reflect on their experiences and the trial, expressing feelings of strength, change, and the struggle for forgiveness or justice. O'Farrill hopes to meet the shooter someday to offer forgiveness, while Bailey does not forgive him. The Teves family desires Alex's presence rather than justice. Weaver believes the trial will stir emotions but focuses on coping strategies like exercise and dist\n",

(CNN)A couple in their 20s, who led a youth ministry, and their baby boy were driving underneath a highway overpass in Bonney Lake, a Seattle suburb, when other motorists heard the crackle of a pending collapse. Concrete from a construction project crashed onto the family's car, killing Josh and Vanessa Ellis and their 8-month-old son, Hudson, authorities said. \"The damage was so severe it was impossible to tell how many victims were in the vehicle. The only thing we had was we could tell there was one victim,\" said Officer Todd Green of Bonney Lake Police Department, according to CNN affiliate KOMO. It took nine hours Monday for crews to remove enough debris to discover the death toll on Angeline Road underneath State Route 410, authorities said. Authorities continued their investigation Tuesday, but initial findings were that there was an ongoing construction project on the highway and a side jersey barrier \"came loose and fell onto the roadway,\" Green told the station. \"When it fell off the overpass, it landed square on the roof of the vehicle,\" Green added. Josh and Vanessa Ellis were youth pastors at the EastPointe Foursquare Church in Puyallup, near Bonney Lake, the church said. The couple earlier wrote a short autobiography on the church website: \"We love to laugh. We are passionate about seeing young people discover the love and grace that Jesus abundantly pours out on them. \"We get really excited about good coffee, quality time with friends and Seattle welcoming an NBA basketball team back to our city,\" the couple wrote. \"We love drive-in movies, frozen yogurt, dates to IKEA and trips to the beach.\" Lead Pastor James Ludlow said his church was reeling. \"We are stunned! Shocked! Wounded, broken and dismayed. But we know one thing for sure ... they are in glory in the loving arms of our King Jesus!\" Ludlow said on the church's Facebook page. Motorist Dawn Nelson was driving behind the Ellis' vehicle. \"I was just a second or two behind him,\" Nelson told KOMO. \"I could hear the three crunch sounds and then it just came down.\" Neighbors recounted a violent collapse. \"I thought a semi had come down the guardrail here in front,\" neighbor Katie Vance told the station. She felt the crash inside her home. \"It was a metal sound and a very heavy sound ... it was through your feet - like a guttural. It shook the whole house,\" she told the affiliate.

Compare that to Earth -- we're about 93 million miles from the sun. Mercury's closeness to the sun makes it hard to see except at dawn and twilight. This may be one reason we don't think about it much. Venus, on the other hand, the planet between Earth and Mercury, appears to be the brightest planet in the sky. It's so bright it's been mistaken for an airplane. Pilot sends plane into dive after mistaking Venus for oncoming plane . But back to Mercury. It's getting some attention from the media now because it's about to get a visitor. The NASA spacecraft MESSENGER (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) is about to crash onto Mercury. The probe was launched in 2004 and traveled more than six and a half years before it started orbiting Mercury on March 18, 2011. Now, MESSENGER is running out of fuel and NASA says it will hit the planet's surface at 8,750 mph (3.91 kilometers per second) around April 30. You won't be able to see it hit because Messenger will crash on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth. There's no way to save the spacecraft, but mission operators at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, have been doing what they can to delay the inevitable. They've been using the little bit of fuel left on board to maneuver the spacecraft to keep it in orbit. They'll do one final maneuver on Friday, April 24. \"Following this last maneuver, we will finally declare the spacecraft out of propellant, as this maneuver will deplete nearly all of our remaining helium gas,\" mission systems engineer Daniel O'Shaughnessy said at a recent media briefing. \"At that point, the spacecraft will no longer be capable of fighting the downward push of the sun's gravity.\" But rather than mourn the loss, scientists held a briefing to celebrate the mission's success. \"For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. One of MESSENGER's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. It also took some amazing photos of the planet. So the MESSENGER mission is ending, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And if you want to see Mercury with your own eyes, you may be in luck if you can find an area with dark skies. It will be visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May.

The NASA spacecraft MESSENGER, studying Mercury since 2011, is about to run out of fuel and crash onto the planet on April 30.

They'll do one final maneuver on Friday, April 24. \"Following this last maneuver, we will finally declare the spacecraft out of propellant, as this maneuver will deplete nearly all of our remaining helium gas,\" mission systems engineer Daniel O'Shaughnessy said at a recent media briefing. \"At that point, the spacecraft will no longer be capable of fighting the downward push of the sun's gravity.\" But rather than mourn the loss, scientists held a briefing to celebrate the mission's success. \"For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. One of MESSENGER's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. It also took some amazing photos of the planet. So the MESSENGER mission is ending, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And if you want to see Mercury with your own eyes, you may be in luck if you can find an area with dark skies. It will be visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May. Your favorite astronomy website will have some helpful guides. Here are a few we found: . • Earthsky.org . •  Astronomy . • Sky and Telescope . • Stardate .  The NASA spacecraft MESSENGER, launched in 2004 to study Mercury, is running out of fuel and set to crash onto Mercury on April 30. Despite the inevitable end, the mission has been hailed as a success, providing valuable information about the planet, such as evidence of ice in the polar regions that could be over two miles thick if spread over an area the size of Washington. As Mercury is difficult to see except at dawn and twilight, it often receives little attention, unlike its neighbor Venus, which appears extremely bright. Following the final maneuver on April 24, MESSENGER will no longer be capable of fighting the downward pull of the sun's gravity. For those interested, Mercury will be visible in the night sky before dusk until the end of May. Various astronomy websites such as Earthsky.org, Astronomy, Sky and Telescope, and Stardate offer guides on how to view Mercury.\n",

(CNN)Hawaii is poised to become the first state in the nation to prohibit the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to anybody under age 21. The state's legislature on Friday passed a bill raising the minimum legal age -- currently 18 -- to buy tobacco or e-cigarettes. The bill will now go before Gov. David Ige, whose signature would make it law in Hawaii as of January 1, 2016. Forty-six U.S. states permit the sale of tobacco to anyone 18 or older, while Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey and Utah require customers to be at least 19. Dozens of cities and towns, including New York, have already raised the minimum legal age for tobacco purchases to 21. \"This bold step will reduce smoking among young people, save lives and help make the next generation tobacco-free,\" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, in a prepared statement. \"Increasing the sale age to 21 will reduce tobacco use among youth and young adults, age groups when nearly all smoking begins and that are heavily targeted by the tobacco industry,\" he said. It was not clear Monday whether Ige would sign the bill, although on Friday he approved legislation banning the the use of e-cigarettes in all locations where smoking is illegal. A spokeswoman for the governor told CNN in an email that he would need some time to review the bill. The legislation comes after a report last month from the Institute of Medicine that said barring people under age 21 from buying cigarettes would have significant public health benefits. Setting the minimum age at 21 nationwide would result in nearly a quarter-million fewer premature deaths and 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer among people born between 2000 and 2019, the report estimated. Raise the smoking age? Report predicts big health benefits if we do . Teenagers, especially those between 15 and 17, are most vulnerable to addiction at a time when their brains are still developing, said the study, which was conducted at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. If the minimum legal age for tobacco use was raised to 21, the prevalence of smokers among today's teens would decline by 12% when they become adults, the report said. Under the Hawaii bill, anyone caught breaking the law would face a $10 fine for the first offense and a $50 fine or community service for a second offense. A 2014 survey of Hawaii voters found that 71% favored raising the legal age to 21.  Hawaii legislature passes a bill increasing the minimum age for tobacco and e-cigarette sales from 18 to 21, making it the first state in the U.S. to do so. The bill awaits Governor David Ige's signature to become law as of January 1, 2016. The move is predicted to have significant public health benefits, with a report estimating that setting the minimum age at 21 nationwide could prevent nearly a quarter-million premature deaths among people born between 2000 and 2019. The fine for violating the law in Hawaii would be $10 for the first offense and $50 for a second offense. Public support for the measure is high, with 71% of Hawaii voters favoring the increase according to a 2014 survey.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Job one for newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch is to create a muscular federal response to months of national unrest over controversial police killings like that of Freddie Gray, 25. Gray's death last week -- from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody -- has touched off days of protests and rioting in Baltimore. Lynch's job won't be easy: As the nation's top law enforcement officer, she takes the reins of a Justice Department that has been walking a fine line between nudging local police departments in the direction of better community relations, and threatening legal action against departments where discrimination or brutality are out of control. But as events in Baltimore demonstrate, too many local departments aren't getting the message. Lynch will need to put down the carrots, pick up the stick and make clear that the Justice Department intends to crack down on police abuse by using one of its most potent weapons: the power to withhold federal funds from local departments. More about that in a moment. The first order of business will be to re-establish order in Baltimore, where the National Guard has been mobilized and a state of emergency declared. \"In the days ahead, I intend to work with leaders throughout Baltimore to ensure that we can protect the security and civil rights of all residents,\" Lynch said within hours of being sworn in on Monday. \"And I will bring the full resources of the Department of Justice to bear in protecting those under threat, investigating wrongdoing and securing an end to violence.\" A key part of that vow -- \"investigating wrongdoing\" -- must include a close look at the Baltimore Police Department, which has been the subject of bitter complaints of brutality. According to a major investigation by The Baltimore Sun published last fall, the city has paid out $5.7 million in court judgments or settlements to more than 100 people since 2011 in connection with allegations of brutality and/or violations of civil rights. \"Officers have battered dozens of residents who suffered broken bones -- jaws, noses, arms, legs, ankles -- head trauma, organ failure, and even death, coming during questionable arrests. Some residents were beaten while handcuffed; others were thrown to the pavement,\" the Sun expose says. \"And in almost every case, prosecutors or judges dismissed the charges against the victims -- if charges were filed at all.\" That kind of behavior helped set the stage for the riots and looting we now see. Lynch has already launched a probe of the death of Freddie Gray, and the Justice Department is also investigating the recent videotaped police killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, where an officer has been arrested and charged with murder. As attorney general, Lynch has several tools with which to guide local law enforcement toward better behavior. A Justice Department program called Community Oriented Policing Services, launched in 2011, helps local departments implement best practices. The COPS program's effectiveness will surely come under question, since Baltimore was one of the eight departments participating in the voluntary program. Lynch can also apply the tougher approach of suing local departments and securing court-ordered reforms, a power conferred by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The provision was a result of the 1991 videotaped police beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles cops and the riot that ensued when the officers were acquitted. The Obama administration has sued local departments 15 times -- more than either the Clinton or Bush administrations -- and has opened 11 more investigations of departments including those in Cleveland, Miami, and Ferguson, Missouri. But even those tough remedies may not be working, according to the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice issues. \"Even where local leaders have embraced Washington's prescriptions, Justice Department officials have increasingly found themselves returning to grapple a second time with problems they thought they had fixed,\" writes reporter Simone Weichselbaum, noting that \"recurring problems have emerged in police departments in Miami, New Orleans and New Jersey, all of which had promised to carry out major changes in response to Justice Department investigations that turned up evidence of discriminatory policing.\" That leaves Lynch with a final, even tougher weapon: the power, under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to deny federal law enforcement dollars to departments that engage in discriminatory practices. Lynch's predecessor as attorney general, Eric Holder, generally refrained from yanking funds, although in 2013 he did deny drug forfeiture money to the sheriff's office in Alamance County, North Carolina, claiming the department was unlawfully targeting Latinos for traffic stops. The sheriff of Alamance County sued the Justice Department and the case remains unresolved -- but it underscores the fact that Lynch has the power to press local departments, legally and financially, to curb local abuses. She should invoke the power where necessary and calm cities like Baltimore as the nation heads into what could be a long, hot summer of unrest.  Newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch is tasked with addressing national unrest over police killings, starting with the case of Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Lynch must balance encouraging better community relations with local police departments and threatening legal action against those with instances of discrimination or brutality. The Baltimore Police Department, under scrutiny for allegations of brutality, is a key focus. Lynch has various tools to influence local law enforcement, including federal funding denial as a punishment for discriminatory practices under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Despite previous attempts at reform, recurring problems persist in some police departments. Lynch should use these powers to address police abuses and maintain order, particularly in cities like Baltimore, to manage anticipated summer unrest.\n",

Lynch will need to implement a more assertive federal response, focusing on improving community relations with local police departments while also threatening legal action against those with discriminatory or abusive practices. She may use the Justice Department's power to withhold federal funds from local departments as a means to combat police abuse. Lynch has already launched investigations into the deaths of Freddie Gray and Walter Scott, and previously, the Obama administration has employed lawsuits and court-ordered reforms to address discriminatory policing in cities such as Cleveland, Miami, and Ferguson, Missouri. However, the effectiveness of these approaches is questionable, as recurring problems have been reported in departments that had previously promised to reform. A final option for Lynch is to withhold federal law enforcement dollars from departments that engage in discriminatory practices, as outlined in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This strategy could potentially help to address and reduce the instances of police brutality in cities like Baltimore.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)The new emojis are here! On Thursday, Apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race, ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just won't cut it. The reaction to this new lineup is, as should be expected with almost anything new in today's hypersensitive climate, a range of cheers and jeers. Why is any of this important, you may ask? For many, these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting. Rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity, sexual orientation, race or even hair color is part of mainstream America -- despite what others might say. This matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day. Think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling. Or more accurately, think of a white face smiling because up until Thursday's update, all the emojis had pale skin. But that has all changed. Now there's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from, including yellow, brown and black. I'm sure few people will be upset with this development. But how about in December? Why? Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji, and that will also include ... Santa Claus. That shrieking sound you may have heard was from Fox News' Megyn Kelly, who famously stated in 2013 that Santa Claus is absolutely, definitely and without a doubt a white guy. In fact, thanks to Apple, we may even see Brown Santa emojis this December. (Could that mean he's a Muslim Santa?! Cue even more shrieking from Fox News.) There is more. Apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis, kissing with a heart over their heads. This inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on Twitter. It's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same-sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of \"religious liberty.\" But it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 GOP presidential candidates might have to say about \"gay emojis.\" And I would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay. The fact is, when you embrace diversity, you will still leave out other minority groups. Redheads, for example, are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color. In fact, supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures. Even expanding the flags represented by emojis, as Apple has done, comes at some peril. Apparently Canada is overjoyed that finally Apple has included it. But Armenians are not happy they were left out. I must admit that being partially of Palestinian heritage, it's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a Palestinian state, Apple has chosen to now include a Palestinian flag emoji. Armenia, I feel your pain. Of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is: What took Apple so long? How hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from? That the company (finally) did is a step in the right direction: America's demographics are changing, so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this. Apple has \"evolved\" in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples. Maybe \"religious liberty\" conservatives who discriminate will follow.  Apple has introduced a more diverse range of emojis in its updated mobile operating system, including various skin tones, same-sex couples, and even a potential Santa Claus of different ethnicities. The changes have sparked various reactions, with some critics such as Megyn Kelly objecting to the idea of a non-white Santa. Additionally, redheads and some minority groups, including Armenians, have expressed dissatisfaction over being left out of the new emoji lineup. The decision to include diverse emojis is seen as a positive step towards reflecting America's changing demographics, though not all minority groups are represented. Some conservatives have criticized the inclusion of same-sex couples, with one hypothetical claim being that such emojis could turn children gay.\n",

(CNN)The new emojis are here! On Thursday, Apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race, ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just won't cut it. The reaction to this new lineup is, as should be expected with almost anything new in today's hypersensitive climate, a range of cheers and jeers. Why is any of this important, you may ask? For many, these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting. Rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity, sexual orientation, race or even hair color is part of mainstream America -- despite what others might say. This matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day. Think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling. Or more accurately, think of a white face smiling because up until Thursday's update, all the emojis had pale skin. But that has all changed. Now there's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from, including yellow, brown and black. I'm sure few people will be upset with this development. But how about in December? Why? Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji, and that will also include ... Santa Claus. That shrieking sound you may have heard was from Fox News' Megyn Kelly, who famously stated in 2013 that Santa Claus is absolutely, definitely and without a doubt a white guy. In fact, thanks to Apple, we may even see Brown Santa emojis this December. (Could that mean he's a Muslim Santa?! Cue even more shrieking from Fox News.) There is more. Apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis, kissing with a heart over their heads. This inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on Twitter. It's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same-sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of \"religious liberty.\" But it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 GOP presidential candidates might have to say about \"gay emojis.\" And I would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay. The fact is, when you embrace diversity, you will still leave out other minority groups. Redheads, for example, are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color. In fact, supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures. Even expanding the flags represented by emojis, as Apple has done, comes at some peril. Apparently Canada is overjoyed that finally Apple has included it. But Armenians are not happy they were left out. I must admit that being partially of Palestinian heritage, it's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a Palestinian state, Apple has chosen to now include a Palestinian flag emoji. Armenia, I feel your pain. Of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is: What took Apple so long? How hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from? That the company (finally) did is a step in the right direction: America's demographics are changing, so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this. Apple has \"evolved\" in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples. Maybe \"religious liberty\" conservatives who discriminate will follow.  Apple has updated its mobile operating system to include a diverse range of emojis, including various skin tones, same-sex couples, and even a potential Santa Claus with different skin tones. This development has sparked mixed reactions, with some celebrating the inclusiveness and others expressing concerns, such as conservative figures like Megyn Kelly, who previously stated that Santa Claus is white. The new emojis, representing a range of ethnicities and orientations, are seen by many as an acknowledgment of diversity in contemporary America and a reflection of changing demographics. However, controversy still arises over omitted minority groups, such as redheads and certain nationalities like Armenia, and potential controversies around same-sex emojis and their impact on children.\n",

The question remains why this change took so long, with some suggesting that the evolution towards greater diversity may prompt other institutions to follow suit.\n",

The new emojis include a range of skin tones, gay and lesbian couple emojis, and even potentially a brown Santa Claus. This development has sparked controversy, with some conservatives expressing dissent, while others celebrate the inclusiveness. The update has also highlighted the absence of representation for other minority groups, such as redheads and certain nationalities like Armenians, who feel left out. The diversity in emojis reflects the changing demographics in America, and it is hoped that this will prompt a broader societal shift towards acceptance and inclusivity.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for \"lost\" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the \"holiday\" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \"mistake\" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \"war on women\" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious \"war on women\" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The \"war on women\" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the \"war on women\" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative \"solution\" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.  Equal Pay Day, marking the point in the year women's wages would catch up to men's, occurs on Tuesday. The 77-cent wage gap statistic is misleading, as it doesn't account for factors like education, profession, and work experience. Clinton's election could center on women voters, and pay equity is a key concern for Democrats. Despite Republican claims that the \"war on women\" narrative is over, women voters remain valuable for Democrats. The right should address pay equity issues, as a lack of response could result in a loss in public support.\n",

      "The misconception persists due to overlooked factors like women's choices and negotiation habits. The conservative party should pay heed to this issue, as women voters remain valuable to Democratic candidates. While the \"war on women\" narrative has shifted from political rhetoric to workplace issues, the right's silence on pay equity could be detrimental. A study by the Independent Women's Forum suggests that the left could win the public debate, but not the overall battle if conservatives fail to present their stance. Thus, it's advisable for the conservative party to engage in a meaningful discussion on pay equity to present a balanced and accurate view.\n",

The 77-cent wage gap statistic frequently cited is inaccurate as it fails to account for various factors such as education, profession, work experience, and negotiation skills. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign is expected to focus on pay equity and fairness in the workplace, but the actual wage gap is much smaller, around 4-6 cents. Despite the smaller wage gap, the Republican Party should not dismiss the issue, as women voters remain crucial. Recent election results indicated that voters preferred policy substance over gendered rhetoric, yet the \"war on women\" narrative persists, particularly concerning workplace issues like pay equity, paid leave benefits, and child care support. The Independent Women's Forum conducted an experiment that showed the progressive message in favor of closing the wage gap did not increase support for Democrats, implying that conservatives should not shy away from addressing the issue but instead present the accurate story on pay equity.\n",

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (The Hollywood Reporter)It may be time to light the lights. ABC is filming a proof of concept for a revival of \"The Muppets,\" The Hollywood Reporter has learned. \"The Big Bang Theory\" co-creator Bill Prady is co-writing the script for a pilot presentation that sources say could be unspooled at May's upfront presentation to Madison Avenue advertisers. Sources tell THR that the project, if all goes well, could go straight to series. Bob Kushell (\"Anger Management,\" \"3rd Rock From the Sun\") will also co-write and is attached to serve as showrunner, with Wilfred's Randall Einhorn attached to exec produce and direct the presentation. ABC's \"Muppets\" revival is being produced by ABC Studios and The Muppet Studios, which Disney owns. The presentation is set to film next weekend on the Disney lot in Burbank with some of the original Muppet performers returning. Sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by Jim Henson — Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Animal, among others — gathering at ABC Studios for a meeting about the new \"Muppet Show.\" However, the show won't move forward unless Miss Piggy signs on, and her current relationship with frequent love Kermit is on the rocks, preventing the show from getting off the ground. Early plans call for two celebrity cameos — including Miss Piggy's current co-star — as well as new roles including Fozzie's girlfriend and her parents. For Prady, the revived \"Muppets\" — which landed at ABC after initial interest from Netflix — marks a return to his roots. The producer, who currently does not have an overall deal, started his career working for Henson in 1982 and ultimately started writing for \"The Jim Henson Hour,\" remaining on the series until a year after Henson's death in 1990. This marks the second time Prady has attempted to revive \"The Muppets.\" The writer-producer shot some test footage before CBS' \"The Big Bang Theory\" that Disney ultimately passed on. For his part, Prady earned an Emmy nomination in 1991 for writing tribute \"The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson\" in 1990 and has contributed writing to Disney's Muppet-themed attractions. Should ABC order \"Muppets\" to series, Prady would juggle both that project and CBS' \"The Big Bang Theory,\" which he exec produces. Created in 1955 by Henson, the original Muppet characters appeared on \"Sam and Friends\" from 1955-61 before going on to appear on late-night talk shows and commercials and becoming a regular part of \"Sesame Street\" in 1969. \"The Muppet Show\" launched on its own as a comedy-variety series and ran from 1976-81, with Kermit serving as the de-facto showrunner on the syndicated series that was produced out of the U.K. The franchise has spawned multiple movies (1979's \"The Muppet Movie,\" 1981's \"The Great Muppet Caper,\" 1984's \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\") as well as NBC's 1989 series \"The Jim Henson Hour.\" Following Henson's death, the franchise continued with \"Muppets Tonight\" airing on ABC in 1996 with reruns airing on sibling Disney Channel from 1997-2000. That was the last television series to feature the Muppets characters. On the feature side, the franchise featured 1992's \"The Muppet Christmas Carol,\" 1996's \"Muppet Treasure Island\" and 1999's \"Muppets From Space,\" the latter two of which were co-produced by Disney, who acquired rights to the Muppets in 2004 and formed The Muppets Studio. The company rebranded the franchise in 2008 with Jason Segel's \"The Muppets,\" with an eighth feature in the franchise, \"Muppets Most Wanted\" bowing in 2014. For ABC, the Muppets revival comes as variety shows are in the midst of a resurgence on the broadcast networks. NBC has made the format a priority, unspooling Marlon Wayans-hosted celebrity variety series \"I Can Do That!\" in the summer and has Neil Patrick Harris entry \"Saturday Night Takeaway\" in the works. The decision to revive \"The Muppets\" also comes as remakes and reboots are having their moment in the sun on the small-screen, as broadcast networks look to fan bases for existing franchises to help cut through the clutter and draw eyeballs in an increasingly crowded scripted space. On the comedy side, \"The Muppets\" arrives as it has become increasingly challenging to launch original scripted half-hours. Prady is repped by Rothman Brecher and Lichter Grossman; Kushell is with ICM Partners; Einhorn is with WME, Odenkirk Provissiero and Bloom Hergott. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.  ABC is planning a revival of \"The Muppets\" with Bill Prady co-writing the script for a pilot presentation. The project could go straight to series if successful, with Bob Kushell as showrunner and Randall Einhorn as executive producer and director. The presentation is set to film next weekend with some original Muppet performers returning.

ABC's \"Muppets\" revival is being produced by ABC Studios and The Muppet Studios, which Disney owns. The presentation is set to film next weekend on the Disney lot in Burbank with some of the original Muppet performers returning. Sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by Jim Henson — Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Animal, among others — gathering at ABC Studios for a meeting about the new \"Muppet Show.\" However, the show won't move forward unless Miss Piggy signs on, and her current relationship with frequent love Kermit is on the rocks, preventing the show from getting off the ground. Early plans call for two celebrity cameos — including Miss Piggy's current co-star — as well as new roles including Fozzie's girlfriend and her parents. For Prady, the revived \"Muppets\" — which landed at ABC after initial interest from Netflix — marks a return to his roots. The producer, who currently does not have an overall deal, started his career working for Henson in 1982 and ultimately started writing for \"The Jim Henson Hour,\" remaining on the series until a year after Henson's death in 1990. This marks the second time Prady has attempted to revive \"The Muppets.\" The writer-producer shot some test footage before CBS' \"The Big Bang Theory\" that Disney ultimately passed on. For his part, Prady earned an Emmy nomination in 1991 for writing tribute \"The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson\" in 1990 and has contributed writing to Disney's Muppet-themed attractions. Should ABC order \"Muppets\" to series, Prady would juggle both that project and CBS' \"The Big Bang Theory,\" which he exec produces. Created in 1955 by Henson, the original Muppet characters appeared on \"Sam and Friends\" from 1955-61 before going on to appear on late-night talk shows and commercials and becoming a regular part of \"Sesame Street\" in 1969. \"The Muppet Show\" launched on its own as a comedy-variety series and ran from 1976-81, with Kermit serving as the de-facto showrunner on the syndicated series that was produced out of the U.K. The franchise has spawned multiple movies (1979's \"The Muppet Movie,\" 1981's \"The Great Muppet Caper,\" 1984's \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\") as well as NBC's 1989 series \"The Jim Henson Hour.\" Following Henson's death, the franchise continued with \"Muppets Tonight\" airing on ABC in 1996 with reruns airing on sibling Disney Channel from 1997-2000. That was the last television series to feature the Muppets characters. On the feature side, the franchise featured 1992's \"The Muppet Christmas Carol,\" 1996's \"Muppet Treasure Island\" and 1999's \"Muppets From Space,\" the latter two of which were co-produced by Disney, who acquired rights to the Muppets in 2004 and formed The Muppets Studio. The company rebranded the franchise in 2008 with Jason Segel's \"The Muppets,\" with an eighth feature in the franchise, \"Muppets Most Wanted\" bowing in 2014. For ABC, the Muppets revival comes as variety shows are in the midst of a resurgence on the broadcast networks. NBC has made the format a priority, unspooling Marlon Wayans-hosted celebrity variety series \"I Can Do That!\" in the summer and has Neil Patrick Harris entry \"Saturday Night Takeaway\" in the works. The decision to revive \"The Muppets\" also comes as remakes and reboots are having their moment in the sun on the small-screen, as broadcast networks look to fan bases for existing franchises to help cut through the clutter and draw eyeballs in an increasingly crowded scripted space. On the comedy side, \"The Muppets\" arrives as it has become increasingly challenging to launch original scripted half-hours.

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)HBO just whetted our appetite for a new season of \"True Detective.\" The network released a teaser video for  season 2 of the critically acclaimed show, and it looks intense. Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch star in the new season, which premieres June 21. Here's the plot synopsis, according to Den of Geek: . \"A bizarre murder brings together three law-enforcement officers and a career criminal, each of whom must navigate a web of conspiracy and betrayal in the scorched landscapes of California. Colin Farrell is Ray Velcoro, a compromised detective in the all-industrial City of Vinci, LA County. Vince Vaughn plays Frank Semyon, a criminal and entrepreneur in danger of losing his life's work, while his wife and closest ally (Kelly Reilly), struggles with his choices and her own. Rachel McAdams is Ani Bezzerides, a Ventura County Sheriff's detective often at odds with the system she serves, while Taylor Kitsch plays Paul Woodrugh, a war veteran and motorcycle cop for the California Highway Patrol who discovers a crime scene which triggers an investigation involving three law enforcement groups, multiple criminal collusions, and billions of dollars.\" Yes, please. The first season starred Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as a pair of Louisiana State Police detectives investigating the death of a young woman. The crime drama proved to be a runaway hit, and the season 1 finale crashed the HBO Go site in March 2014.

      "Write a summary of the source text. The summary should be short in length. The length is defined in terms of number of words used in the summary. The source text is given below.  (CNN)A Columbia University student who was accused of rape is suing the New York City school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a \"serial rapist\" According to the lawsuit, Paul Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in Emma Sulkowicz's 2013 rape claim, as well as others that came to light after Sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews. Her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school's handling of the complaint, saying she hoped to show how \"flawed\" the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases. CNN does not usually name individuals in sexual assault cases, but in this instance, both parties have spoken publicly about their experience. They have also both said in separate interviews with The New York Times that Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing. Nungesser, an international student from Germany, filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school; its president, Lee Bollinger; and the visual arts professor who oversaw Sulkowicz's mattress project, \"Carry That Weight,\" as part of her senior thesis. The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Nungesser's right to an education free of gender-based discrimination by allowing Sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing. During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a \"serial rapist\" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus. The harassment continued, the lawsuit claims, when Columbia visual arts professor Jon Kessler let Sulkowicz \"transform her personal vendetta\" into a \"Columbia-sponsored calumny\" by supporting \"Carry That Weight\" for her senior thesis, allowing her to earn school credit through \"this outrageous display of harassment and defamation.\" Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia. \"This is a person who is one of my students, and I care about all of my students. And when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment, I am affected by that. This is all very painful.\" The defendants \"had the power, as well as the legal and contractual obligation\" to protect Nungesser, who is also a senior, the lawsuit claims. \"By refusing to protect Paul Nungesser, Columbia University first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it.\" Columbia University declined to comment on the lawsuit. The school also declined to confirm the outcome of Nungesser's disciplinary proceedings. \"As we have said consistently, we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law, but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff, the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them,\" spokesman Robert Hornsby said in statement. Kessler also declined to comment on the lawsuit. The case has produced dueling narratives from both sides in national media outlets. The most recent came from Nungesser in a Daily Beast article titled, \"Columbia Student: I Didn't Rape Her,\" in which he shared a long exchange of Facebook messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual. Some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit, but Sulkowicz told CNN they were taken out of context in the suit. She also balked at the idea that Nungesser would sue the school or her professor \"for allowing me to make an art piece.\" \"It's ridiculous that he would read it as a 'bullying strategy,' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I've experienced at Columbia,\" Sulkowicz wrote in an email. \"If artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences, then how are we to heal?\" The project essentially consists of Sulkowicz carrying a twin-size mattress wherever she goes on campus, but not off campus. She's allowed to accept help carrying the object but does not allow herself to ask for help.​ . Nungesser's complaint seeks damages to be determined at trial for harm to his reputation, loss of educational opportunities and future career prospects.

(CNN)The cover-up is often worse than the crime. Henry Louis Gates stands accused of scrubbing part of a segment in his PBS documentary series \"Finding Your Roots\" because the actor Ben Affleck put pressure on him. Affleck's concern was that the segment would have aired his family's dirty laundry, which includes a slaveholding ancestor, Benjamin Cole. Affleck said, in a statement posted on Facebook, that he \"didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed.\" And Gates later explained that he subbed that part of the segment for another that made for more \"compelling television.\" But providing a window into the importance of slavery's past to America's present should never just be about what makes for good television.

What more could he do if his instinct is also to tackle issues closer to home: the legacy of slavery in his own family tree and how it is possible -- necessary -- to reject the racism passed through generations even today.

In any case, why did he agree to do a television show if he was concerned about what might be discovered? He could have paid a genealogist to uncover his ancestry, if privacy was what he wanted. The irony here is that none of this would have ever been found out if Sony's emails had not been hacked and if Gates hadn't written to Michael Lynton, CEO of Sony Entertainment, for advice. In the leaked exchange, Lynton advised: \"I would take it out if no one knows, but if it gets out that you are editing the material based on this kind of sensitivity then it gets tricky.\" Gates acknowledges that to delete the segment at the request of a guest \"would be a violation of PBS rules.\" Then he does it anyway. Gates, however, denies doing this.

If Gates thought there was no need for the slavery segment because it didn't make for good television, there would have been no need to consult with Lynton; Gates could have given Affleck what he wanted because he made the assessment of how strong Affleck's story was. The original script, reprinted on Gawker and elsewhere, makes it clear, however, that the slave-owner angle makes for better television. Here are some excerpts: . Gates sets up the segment describing Benjamin Cole as living in Savannah, Georgia. Affleck responds that he has a house in Savannah. Gates says \"Really?\" and asks whether he knew he had roots there. Affleck says he had no idea he had any Southern roots at all. Then the voice-over lowers the boom: \"We wanted to see if we could learn how Ben's ancestor felt about (slavery).\" Gates shows the slave schedule of the 1850 Census to Affleck, who says, \"There's Benjamin Cole, owned 25 slaves.\" Affleck says, \"It gives me a kind of sagging feeling to see, uh, a biological relationship to that. But you know, there it is, part of our history.\" Gates then says: \"But consider the irony, in your family line. Your mom went back fighting for the rights of black people in Mississippi, 100 years later. That's amazing.\" Affleck then observes: \"Indeed, people like my mother and many others who have made a much better America than the one that they were handed.\" What a great line. What a great story. And indeed when a public figure -- a celebrity -- chooses to confront the past like this, instead of ignoring it, he can provide a powerful example to a country that struggles daily with the roots of racism in its present. This is the kind of enlightened approach Gates and PBS should have been interested in facilitating. White Americans' lack of comfort in talking about slavery, race and the places in our society where racism continues to fester is at the heart of why even with a black president, we are still, as a country, far from post-racial.

Gates has to deal with PBS and WNET's internal review. He should not walk away without consequences. If you're going to run with the megastars, you need to have mega-ethics.  Henry Louis Gates, a documentary series producer, is accused of altering a segment due to pressure from actor Ben Affleck. The segment, which would have exposed Affleck's slaveholding ancestor, was allegedly changed to avoid embarrassment. This missed an opportunity to address America's history of slavery and Affleck's initial reluctance to acknowledge his ancestry is surprising. Affleck, who recently testified for foreign aid in the Democratic Republic of Congo, could have used this as a chance to address the legacy of slavery in his own family. The controversy arose due to emails revealing Sony's CEO's advice to edit the segment out. Gates denies the allegations, maintaining editorial control. The original script suggests the segment was effective in addressing slavery's impact on modern racism. Gates faces internal review for the alteration, which raises questions about ethical standards when working with celebrities.\n",

Two al Qaeda hostages, Warren Weinstein of the United States and Giovanni Lo Porto from Italy, were killed in the same strike, while Gadahn died in another U.S. operation that month. Before that, Farouq was the deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, or AQIS, a branch of the Islamist extremist group that formed in recent years. The branch made its presence known in September 2014, when militants infiltrated Pakistan's navy and tried to hijack one of its ships, according to the SITE Institute, which monitors terror groups. The group's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud, on Twitter compared the Pakistani naval officers involved in the attempted hijacking to Nidal Hasan, SITE reported. Hasan is the U.S. Army psychiatrist sentenced to death for killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas. Osama Mehmood, a spokesman for al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, said that Farouq and another top figure, Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in a January 15 drone strike in Pakistan's Shawal Valley.

Ahmed Farouq, an American national, was a significant figure in the terrorist group al Qaeda, despite not achieving the same level of renown as Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki, or Adam Gadahn. Farouq served as the deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), a branch of the Islamist extremist group that emerged recently. In September 2014, AQIS made headlines when its militants attempted to hijack a Pakistani naval ship, an act compared to the Fort Hood shooting by the group's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud. Farouq and another top AQIS leader, Qari Abdullah Mansur, were reportedly killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan's Shawal Valley on January 15, 2020. Along with Farouq and Mansur, two hostages, Warren Weinstein of the United States and Giovanni Lo Porto from Italy, were also killed in the same strike, while Gadahn died in a separate U.S. operation that month.

Shanghai, China (CNN)When China's biggest auto show opens in Shanghai this week, the only models on display will be the ones with four wheels. Gone, show organizers hope, will be the scantily-clad \"car babes\" that in previous years have posed provocatively on car hoods and sashayed through the aisles to draw crowds to the 9-day event. The focus, instead, will be the latest offerings from an array of global car manufacturers, which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for Chinese customers in what since 2009 has been the world's largest car market. \"It's a major industry event for us,\" said Andrew Boyle, global product communications manager at Rolls Royce. It sells several hundred of its super-luxury vehicles in China each year, and in Shanghai this week will launch its latest model, the Phantom Limelight. Vehicle sales in China totaled 23.5 million units last year, almost a third more than in the United States. However, the show comes at a turning point for China's auto market, which is facing a second year of slower growth in 2015 after a decade-long sales and production frenzy. Intense competition for China's drivers means that car manufacturers are increasingly developing vehicles that cater to Chinese preferences. Nissan will use Auto Shanghai 2015 to unveil the Lannia mid-size sedan, which it says has been specially created for \"the rising young Chinese generation.\" The country's gearheads have embraced the SUV or sport utility vehicle, sales of which jumped a third last year, and many will feature in the displays planned by dozens of European, Japanese U.S., South Korea and Chinese automakers. This year MG, once known for its sleek sports cars and now owned by Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, enters the fray with its first SUV, the GS, while Ford will give two new luxury SUVs their China market debut --  the Lincoln MKX and Lincoln Navigator, the latter favored by hip hop stars. \"The SUV is popular as a first car,\" said Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Bain & Company. \"If you only have one, you want one that you can commute in and take on a road trip.\" Foreign brands have dominated sales in the past two years, but as they improve product quality and design, local rivals like Geely, which also owns Sweden's Volvo, and Great Wall Motor are clawing back market share, especially when it comes to SUVs. Geely, which already exports to Russia, the Middle East and Africa, is also stepping up its efforts to crack more developed markets. It is preparing to export the Volvo S60 Inscription to the United States from a factory in the southwestern city of Chengdu. It would be the first car made in China to hit U.S showrooms and may pave the way for Chinese brands to shake up the U.S. market like Japanese and Korean car manufacturers did decades earlier. With car ownership still at much lower levels than the U.S. and Europe, China is likely to remain the industry's most important market for decades. However, the breakneck growth may be a thing of the past. In 2014, growth in sales halved to 7% and according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the slowdown continued in the first three months of this year when sales rose just 3.9%. It comes as the wider economy slows and a prolonged campaign against corruption has hit sales of luxury vehicles, especially brands like Audi that have been the ride of choice for Chinese officials. On top of that, the hassles of car ownership are deterring some potential buyers, as is an awareness of the environmental costs. Congested and chaotic roads, restrictions on the number of new vehicle license plates and a shortage of residential parking space  may trigger a backlash against car ownership, according to a recent report from Bain & Company. \"The car was seen as a status symbol,\" says Pierre-Henri Boutot, a partner at Bain and co-author of the report. \"But now in larger cities they see the hassle and some of these people are thinking of giving up their car.\" Just maybe, China will need those car babes to boost sales after all.  The Auto Shanghai 2015 auto show, taking place in Shanghai, China, will focus on the latest automobile offerings from global manufacturers, with an emphasis on catering to Chinese preferences. The event will witness the launch of various models, including Rolls Royce's Phantom Limelight, Nissan's Lannia mid-size sedan, and new SUVs from Ford and MG. The Chinese auto market, which has been the world's largest since 2009, is facing slower growth after a decade-long sales and production frenzy. The market is seeing increased competition, with foreign brands improving product quality and design, and local rivals, such as Geely and Great Wall Motor, gaining market share, particularly in the SUV segment. Despite the slowdown, China is expected to remain a crucial market for the automobile industry for many decades due to low car ownership levels compared to the U.S. and Europe. The hassles of car ownership, environmental concerns, and a backlash against congested roads may, however, potentially reduce demand for vehicles in the future.\n",

However, the Chinese auto market is facing slower growth after a decade-long sales and production frenzy, with sales growth halving to 7% in 2014 and continuing to slow in the first quarter of 2015. Factors contributing to this slowdown include a slower economy, a crackdown on corruption that has impacted sales of luxury vehicles, and a growing awareness of the environmental costs and hassles associated with car ownership. As car ownership levels remain lower than in the U.S. and Europe, China is expected to remain a key market for the industry for decades to come. Yet, the breakneck growth of the past may be a thing of the past. In an effort to boost sales, some manufacturers may need to reintroduce marketing strategies such as employing \"car babes,\" as observed in previous years.\n",

      "A 21-year-old industrial design student, Jackson Gordon, creates an authentic, functional replica of Batman's suit.

The armor is made with materials like Kevlar, memory foam, and ¼\" Kydex plastic for strength, protection, and mobility. The cowl was more challenging to make, requiring a mold of Gordon's head, sculpting clay, and a two-part box mold. The final product has been approved by Legendary, and it's been showcased at conventions and universities. Gordon's business, Armatus Design, plans to sell the cowls to the public in a few weeks, with demand coming from various communities such as martial artists, motorcycle riders, and even cosplay enthusiasts. The suit will not have the iconic bat symbol due to copyright issues. After completing his studies, Gordon intends to scale up the business, maintaining it as a one-man operation for now.\n",

His motivation stemmed from dissatisfaction with the mobility and protection offered by his initial costume.\n",

Gordon's Batman persona emerged five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay, creating a version of the Batsuit inspired by Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy.'

      "The ongoing drought in California, a major agricultural hub, impacts the nation as it grows over a third of U.S. vegetables and nearly two-thirds of fruits and nuts. This drought has led to higher prices for fruits and vegetables, with an expected rise in prices this year due to inflation. Not only California is affected; states like Texas and Oklahoma are also experiencing extreme drought. The drought has increased beef and veal prices in 2014. The drought has affected the tourism industry in California, with restaurants limiting water service and ski resorts shutting down early. However, the wine industry in California has benefited from the drought, producing terrific quality vintages in the last few years. The California drought affects over 52 million people, and its impact on food prices is uncertain due to factors like the strength of the U.S. dollar and the drop in oil prices.\n",

      "The ongoing drought in California, a major agricultural hub for the United States, is causing increased food prices nationwide as it impacts the growth of fruits, vegetables, and nuts. According to a USDA economist, the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, while those of fresh vegetables may increase by 2% to 3%. The drought is also affecting other states such as Texas and Oklahoma, which are experiencing extreme and exceptional droughts, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The drought has led to increased beef and veal prices and may cause farmers to plant fewer crops, which could further boost supermarket prices. Additionally, the drought has impacted the hospitality industry, with restaurants only serving water upon request and hotels asking for requests for laundered linens and towels. However, the 2014 wine grape harvest was \"third in a string of great vintages this decade,\" with wine grapes using relatively low water, resulting in a good supply of California wine.\n",

The drought, now in its fourth year, has resulted in mandatory water reduction measures in cities, which could potentially lead to increased prices for certain food items.\n",

      "In 2014, prices rose for several kitchen staples due to the drought, such as berries, broccoli, grapes, melons, packaged salad, and peppers. While prices decreased in February 2015, overall prices are projected to rise this year due to inflation, with fresh fruit prices expected to increase by 2.5%-3.5%, and vegetable prices by 2%-3%. The strength of the U.S. dollar has allowed for the importation of crops affected by the drought, and the drop in oil prices has reduced the cost of transporting food from California to other states.\n",

This drought has led to price increases for various grocery items, including berries, broccoli, grapes, melons, packaged salad, and peppers. While the effects of the drought on food prices are uncertain for 2016 due to a strong dollar allowing for more food imports, there is a widespread drought throughout the West and Southwest, affecting states like Texas and Oklahoma. The drought has resulted in increased prices for beef and veal, with projections suggesting a continued rise in beef prices this year. Additionally, the drought has influenced changes in tourist destinations in California, such as reducing water availability in restaurants, fewer homes running decorative fountains, and earlier closures of ski resorts. However, the California wine industry has reported that the drought has resulted in a third consecutive year of great vintages, with a good supply of California wine, possibly the only positive aspect of the drought.\n",

Economists predict further food price rises this year due to inflation, but the impact of the drought is uncertain due to a strong dollar allowing for imports. Other regions such as Texas and Oklahoma are also experiencing extreme drought, affecting over 52 million people in the West and Southwest. The drought is leading to increased beef and veal prices, smaller grazing pastures, and difficulties for cattlemen in those regions. The drought has led to changes in California's hospitality industry, with restaurants not serving water unless requested and some ski resorts shutting down early and converting to other attractions.

The drought is also impacting the cattle industry in states like Texas and Oklahoma, causing beef and veal prices to rise. Despite these challenges, California's wine industry has been producing high-quality grapes in the drought years, resulting in record harvests.

The use of hostages by rogue regimes to extract concessions, humiliate the United States, or signal unease is highlighted as a consistent pattern. Historical examples include the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, North Korea's detention of two journalists working for Al Gore's Current TV during Obama's presidency, and Saddam Hussein's capture of two American defense contractors in 1995. The text implies that diplomats often underestimate the true character and disregard for diplomatic norms exhibited by rogue regimes, using hostage situations as indicators of such behaviors.\n",

      "President Barack Obama revealed that a U.S. drone strike killed two hostages, Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, held by al Qaeda on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Similarly, Iranian-American journalist Jason Rezaian was charged with espionage on April 20, 2015, the day before talks in Vienna, Austria, to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran. Hostage-taking by rogue regimes, such as Iran, North Korea, and the Taliban, is a strategy to extract concessions, humiliate the U.S., or signal unease during diplomatic negotiations. The historical example of the Iran hostage seizure in 1979 highlights this pattern, where rogue regimes use hostages to block reconciliation.\n",

Four victims, including Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, Martin Richard, and Sean Collier, were killed in the bombings in 2013. The families of the victims gave emotional testimonies describing their loss and the impact the bombings had on their lives. Tsarnaev is also facing testimony from survivors, including Gillian Reny and Celeste Corcoran, who were maimed in the bombings. Prosecutors are using these testimonies to show the impact of the bombings on victims and to argue for the death penalty. The jury must now decide whether Tsarnaev should live or die for his crimes.

      "The Boston Marathon bombing trial has entered its victim impact phase, during which family members and survivors of the 2013 attack have testified about the emotional and physical toll the bombings had on them. Four individuals, including a 29-year-old restaurant manager named Krystle Campbell, a Chinese graduate student named Lingzi Lu, an 8-year-old boy named Martin Richard, and a campus police officer named Sean Collier, were killed in the attack. Many others were maimed, with some losing limbs. Testimony from survivors has been heart-wrenching, with one senior in high school, Gillian Reny, describing the chilling silence and chaos that followed the explosion near her. Another witness, Celeste Corcoran, recalled the surreal, out-of-body experience she had after losing both legs in the blast. Prosecutors are using the testimonies to argue for the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the alleged bomber, who has been found guilty on every count. They have described Tsarnaev as unconcerned, unrepentant, and unchanged, and as someone who saw his victims as \"the enemy.\"\n",

      "The Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was found guilty on all charges for detonating bombs that resulted in the death of four young people and injuries to several others in 2013. The victims' families are now testifying in the sentencing phase of the trial, sharing heartbreaking stories of loss, grief, and physical hardship caused by the attacks. The victims included a 29-year-old restaurant manager, Krystle Campbell, a Chinese grad student, Lingzi Lu, an 8-year-old boy, Martin Richard, and a campus police officer, Sean Collier. The jury is deciding whether Tsarnaev should face the death penalty for his crimes.

During the victim impact part of the case, several family members of the four victims who were killed in the bombings testified about their grief and loss. William A. Campbell Sr., whose daughter Krystle Campbell was killed in the first blast, spoke about how she was the light of his life and how no one can fill the space she once occupied. Lingzi Lu's father also testified, describing her as a jolly soul. Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad, and Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service as a big-hearted, big-smiling, big-servicing individual, were also among the victims whose stories were shared. The prosecutor argued that Tsarnaev murdered his victims in a cruel and terrorizing manner, and that he saw them as the enemy. The jury was shown graphic images of the aftermath of the bombings and of Tsarnaev's defiant attitude towards the authorities. The people who were maimed by the bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial, sharing stories of their injuries and their struggles to recover.

      "California Governor Jerry Brown implemented mandatory statewide water restrictions due to a four-year drought, setting an example for nation-wide water conservation. The drought won't be the last or worst of this century, and agriculture, a major water consumer, is not included in the current measures. California's water distribution system, developed during a wetter phase and smaller population, encourages heavy water use in dry areas, wasting water. Climate change is not definitively linked to the California drought, but the severity and frequency of droughts may increase as the planet warms. The drought's impact on the nation and the world is significant; water scarcity is a global problem, similar to California's issue in other parts of the world. The connection of a specific extreme weather event to climate change is often debatable, but the overall reality and risks of human-induced global warming are not. \"No-regrets\" measures, like making California's water distribution system more efficient, can help prepare for future climates and reduce waste, even if climate change is not the sole cause of the event.\n",

      "California Governor Jerry Brown has implemented mandatory statewide water restrictions for the first time due to a four-year-long drought. This action is significant as it highlights the need for sustainable water management in light of population and economic growth. The current water distribution system, developed in a smaller population and historically wet phase, encourages water waste and does not effectively allocate or price water. The new measures aim to address this issue, but exclude large agricultural users. The drought is not solely attributed to climate change, but its occurrence is influenced by it. The global implications of California's water management are profound, as water scarcity is a major issue in many parts of the world, including India and Syria. The drought in Syria has been linked to human-induced climate change, contributing to ongoing conflicts. The California drought can serve as a wake-up call for addressing climate change, regardless of whether specific extreme weather events can be directly attributed to it. Measures aimed at reducing waste and preparing for future climates, often called \"no-regrets\" measures, are beneficial regardless of the pace of global warming.\n",

      "Summary: California, currently experiencing its fourth year of severe drought, has implemented mandatory statewide water restrictions for the first time in history. This move, led by Governor Jerry Brown, signals a recognition that economic and population growth must take into account the physical limitations imposed by the planet. Historically, California's water distribution system was developed during a time of smaller population and a wetter climate, leading to inefficiencies such as high water use in dry regions, inconsistent allocation, and lack of pricing and waste disincentives. Brown's measures, while temporary, could potentially lead to a long-term reformation of the state's water distribution system. This reform may include large agricultural users, who are not currently included.\n",
      "\n",
      "The global significance of California's actions is noteworthy, particularly in the context of water scarcity issues in other parts of the world. For example, over-depletion of groundwater is a problem in the Indian subcontinent, mirroring California's situation. Additionally, a study published by Columbia University argued that drought in Syria contributed to the ongoing conflict there, and presented evidence that human-induced climate change played a role in the Syrian drought.\n",

      "The relationship between the current California drought and climate change is complex. While a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggests that global warming did not directly cause the drought, it does exacerb\n",

      "California Governor Jerry Brown has implemented mandatory statewide water restrictions for the first time due to a four-year-long drought. This action, prompted by a local crisis, has implications for the nation as a whole, signifying the need for sustainable water use practices in light of population and economic growth. California's outdated water distribution system, developed during a historically wet phase and with little consideration for water conservation, encourages heavy water usage in dry regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "California's drought, which won't be the last or worst this century, mirrors water shortage issues in various parts of the world, such as the Indian subcontinent. Climate change, driven by human activities, is believed to worsen these situations by exacerbating droughts, as demonstrated in Syria's ongoing conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a recent report suggests that the current California drought may not be directly attributable to climate change, it increases the risk of such events happening. However, the connection between specific extreme weather events and climate change is often a subject of scientific controversy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The focus should be on the broader picture of human-caused global warming and its significant risks, rather than solely on the attribution of individual events. Addressing these issues through measures like making California's water distribution system more efficient can help prepare for future climates and represent \"no-regrets\" measures, beneficial regardless of the pace of global\n",

      "California Governor Jerry Brown has enforced the first statewide water restrictions in response to a four-year drought. This action underscores the need for sustainable water usage considering the planet's physical limits. California's current water distribution system, developed during a historically wet phase and smaller population, encourages heavy water usage in dry regions. The new measures aim to address waste and inconsistency, though agricultural users are not initially included.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drought's impact extends beyond California, as water scarcity is a global issue. In the Indian subcontinent, rapid development depletes groundwater similarly to California, and Syria's ongoing war may have been partly caused by drought exacerbated by human-induced climate change. The connection between climate change and specific extreme weather events can be debated, but the reality of human-caused global warming is indisputable.\n",
      "\n",
      "California's water management strategies, aiming to reduce waste and prepare for future climates, can serve as an example for other regions. These \"no-regrets\" measures, beneficial regardless of the rate of global warming, may help mitigate the effects of future climate change.\n",

The source text suggests that climate change may contribute to but not directly cause the drought, highlighting the need for no-regrets measures that aim to better prepare for climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Lynch, an African-American woman and the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee vote in February.

The United States has been actively targeting AQAP leaders in Yemen, but the country has been in a state of disarray since the Houthi rebels asserted themselves last year, seizing the capital of Sanaa and ousting Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi.

This surge in investigations indicates ongoing complex inquiries initiated when ISIS seized territories a year ago. ISIS' propaganda, amplified by the media, has been instrumental in its rapid recruitment. Unlike Al Qaeda, ISIS has attracted more U.S.-based recruits.

ISIS aims to present itself as a legitimate government, offering services like hospitals and maternity wards. In the education system, ISIS has banned subjects like democracy, political thought, hotel management, tourism, archaeology, and allowed only segregated education for girls up to the age of 15. The ISIS Health Department manages hospitals, and there is a more nuanced interpretation of religion compared to Afghanistan and Taliban-controlled areas, with vaccinations allowed and girls allowed to attend school. However, entertainment is regulated, and idol worship is strictly forbidden. ISIS portrays itself as more just and fair than the previous ruler, with examples like lowering bread prices in Syria. Entertainment is allowed, but only if it does not distract from religious obligations. The ISIS regime is absolute, with no acknowledgment of borders in bus schedules, and detained ISIS members speak from Iraqi jails. ISIS's strategy is to present a religiously learned image, using religious texts to justify their actions and make themselves impervious to any religion-based counterargument.\n",

While not legally binding, the certificates are seen as progress by advocates of marriage equality in Japan. Shibuya's decision may encourage neighboring Setagaya ward to follow suit.

      "Tokyo's Shibuya ward, a popular shopping and entertainment district, has passed an ordinance enabling same-sex couples to obtain partnership certificates, granting them hospital visitation rights and co-signed tenancy agreements. While these certificates are not legally binding, they offer some parity with heterosexual married couples. Shibuya's mayor, Toshitake Kuwahara, proposed the measure in February. Gay rights activists see this as a step towards marriage equality in socially conservative Japan, where discrimination against the LGBT community, though rare, can be subtle. The ordinance is a \"big first step for the protection of human rights\" according to Taiga Ishikawa, Tokyo councillor and Japan's first male gay local assembly member. Neighboring Setagaya ward may also consider following Shibuya's lead, but a national law is necessary to secure equal rights for gay couples. The first recognition and support for the LGBT community in Japan was in Yodogawa ward, Osaka, in 2013.

However, the text suggests that Saudi Arabia's motives are not pure, but rather an attempt to prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self-determination. The text also highlights the Saudi Arabia's history of not allowing regional competition, including their support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy in Egypt in 2013. The text criticizes the American decision to support the Saudi attack on Yemen, arguing that it is misguided and that the Saudi war on Yemen will undermine the U.S. aim of preventing al Qaeda from making Yemen a safe haven, and potentially empower al Qaeda.

Instead, Saudi Arabia's motives are rooted in its history of thwarting regional competition and combating efforts to build democratic governments. The Saudi kingdom has shown a preference for counterrevolutionary policies, as evidenced by its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy in Egypt in 2013. The real goal is to prevent the rise of popularly supported governments in the region that seek self-determination. The U.S.'s decision to back the Saudi attack on Yemen is criticized as misguided, as it places Saudi ambitions to control Yemen above previous American priorities like combating al-Qaeda in the region. The Obama administration appears to have abandoned Yemen to Saudi machinations, potentially setting a dangerous precedent. To avoid undermining U.S. efforts in Yemen, the Obama administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict, one that can be embraced by various Yemeni factions to prevent further opening the Yemeni door to Iran and empowering al-Qaeda.\n",

This is evident from Saudi support for the 2013 military coup in Egypt and previous attempts to suppress the Houthis, a group in Yemen that is currently receiving help from Iran. The American decision to support the Saudi attack on Yemen is criticized as misguided, as it risks undermining US aims in Yemen, such as preventing Yemen from becoming a safe haven for al Qaeda. A more political solution to the conflict is suggested, to prevent further opening the Yemeni door to Iran and empowering al Qaeda. The summary also notes that the Saudi campaign's results are unlikely to be positive, as a larger group of Houthi rebels has replaced the ragtag group of 2009, and they have already been able to withstand Saudi bombardment.\n",

This pattern was evident in Saudi Arabia's support for the military coup in Egypt in 2013 that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsy. In Yemen, the real objective is to prevent the rise of any popularly supported government seeking self-determination, with the excuse of resisting Iran's influence merely serving as sectarian bluster. The Saudi bombing of the Houthis, while unquestionably anti-American, has not targeted any American interests, as demonstrated by the Houthis' delivery of American-owned armored SUVs to a U.N. representative in Yemen. Concerns about the Saudi-Gulf narrative on Yemen, which places Saudi ambitions to control Yemen above previous American priorities like countering terrorism, have led to the U.S. effectively abandoning Yemen to Saudi machinations.

Lakhvi is accused of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in India that left over 160 people dead. Despite still facing trial, Lakhvi posted bail of 2 million Pakistani rupees. India, Pakistan's neighbor and rival, has strongly criticized Lakhvi's release, accusing Pakistan of having a dual policy on dealing with terrorists, and of treating India differently in terrorism cases. The Mumbai attacks involved heavily armed men storming landmark buildings, including luxury hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station, and a Jewish cultural center, resulting in the death of over 160 people.

The Pakistani Anti-Terrorism Court granted Lakhvi bail last year, a decision the Pakistani government had previously challenged, but the Lahore High Court ordered his release on Thursday. Lakhvi posted bail totaling 2 million Pakistani rupees (over $19,000). India strongly criticized the move, with its Ministry of External Affairs stating that it reinforces the perception that Pakistan has a dual policy on dealing with terrorists, and those who have carried out attacks or pose a threat to India are being dealt with differently. The accusation highlights long-running tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, which have fought three wars against each other since their partition at the end of British colonial rule. Pakistan's Foreign Office responded by saying that it would not be proper to cast aspersions on Pakistan's commitment to countering terrorism at a time when Pakistan is entering a critical stage of defeating the menace of terrorism.

      "Summary: Professor Mark Goodacre, an expert on the New Testament and Christian origins at Duke University, discusses viewer questions about Mary Magdalene on CNN's \"Finding Jesus.\" The most intriguing questions include the age of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, its translation, the whereabouts of Mary Magdalene after the events in the New Testament, and whether the Church Fathers wrote about Jesus being married. Goodacre explains that the copy of the Gospel seen in the show dates from the fifth century, with fragments dating from the third century. The Gospel is not actually called \"The Gospel of Mary Magdalene\" and its dating is challenging due to the lack of references to it in antiquity. The origin of the name \"Magdalene\" is uncertain, and the Gospel of Mary was likely too late to be included in the canonical Gospels. No ancient texts indicate Jesus had a wife, although the Gospel of Philip does suggest Mary Magdalene was Jesus' companion.\n",

Questions include the date and origin of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, the fate of Mary Magdalene after the events in the New Testament, and why the Gospel was left out of the biblical canon. Goodacre clarifies that the Gospel of Mary Magdalene is not actually called that in the texts we have, and that it is difficult to date. He also addresses the idea of Jesus being married, stating that there are no ancient texts that confirm this.

The session was led by Mark Goodacre, a professor of New Testament and Christian origins at Duke University who was an on-camera expert on the show. Some of the questions addressed include the age of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, where to find a good translation, the mysteries surrounding Mary Magdalene after the events in the canonical Gospels, the idea of Jesus being married, and why the Gospel of Mary Magdalene was not included in the canon of 66 Biblical books. Goodacre provides answers to these questions, explaining that the Gospel itself was likely written in the middle to late second century, there is no ancient evidence of Jesus being married, and the Gospel of Mary was probably written too late to compete with the canonical Gospels. He also points out that the Gospel of Philip, which describes Mary Magdalene as Jesus' companion, is too late to be reliable about the historical Mary Magdalene. The article concludes with a suggestion for those interested in exploring these topics further to listen to Goodacre's podcast, the NT Pod.\n",

      "The summary is based on a CNN article discussing questions from viewers about Mary Magdalene, answered by Professor Mark Goodacre, a New Testament and Christian origins expert. The Gospel of Mary Magdalene, dated to the second century, exists in three fragments, with the most complete one from the fifth century. There are no reliable ancient texts suggesting that Jesus was married. The Gospel of Mary Magdalene was not included in the Bible's canon due to its late creation and different theology from the four canonical Gospels.\n",

      "In this article, Professor Mark Goodacre of Duke University, who served as series adviser and expert on the CNN series \"Finding Jesus,\" answers viewer questions regarding Mary Magdalene from the show's finale. Goodacre clarifies that the copy of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene seen in the show dates from the 5th century and is located in Berlin, Germany, but there are fragments from the 3rd century as well. The exact age of the Gospel itself is difficult to determine as there are no references to it in antiquity. The common name \"Magdalene\" likely references Mary's hometown, Magdala.\n",
      "\n",
      "Questions regarding Mary Magdalene's historical presence in the New Testament also arise. Goodacre explains that Mary Magdalene is absent from the Acts of the Apostles, Paul's letters, and other texts, leading to the possibility that her memory was suppressed in the early church. However, Goodacre points out that the Gospel writers do pay significant attention to Mary Magdalene in their Passion and Resurrection narratives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Goodacre addresses the question of whether Jesus was married, stating that there are no ancient texts that confirm Jesus was married.

Astronomer Amy Mainzer, who discovered Asteroid 316201 in 2010, chose to honor Malala due to the lack of female and women of color represented among named asteroids. This asteroid, known as 2010 ML48, circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and a half years and is around 4 kilometers in diameter with a dark surface. Mainzer, a supporter of Malala's education work, believes it's crucial to utilize the brainpower of all smart individuals, regardless of gender, to tackle humanity's complex issues.\n",

      "Malala Yousafzai, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and education activist from Pakistan, has been immortalized in the heavens through the naming of an asteroid after her. NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, made the decision to name Asteroid 316201, which she discovered in June 2010, as 316201 Malala or 2010 ML48. This asteroid, located between Mars and Jupiter, takes 5.5 years to circle the sun and is approximately 4 kilometers in diameter with a dark surface, similar to printer toner. Mainzer felt compelled to name the asteroid after Malala due to the lack of women, and particularly women of color, being represented among named asteroids. As a scientist, Mainzer believes in the importance of girls' education as a means to increase human potential, noting that all smart people are needed to solve humanity's most difficult problems and that we cannot afford to reject half the population. This asteroid dedication serves as a testament to Malala's significant impact and lasting legacy in advocating for girls' education.\n",

      "Summary: A group of 105 migrants attempting to sail from Libya to Italy in a rubber boat were intercepted by Italian authorities on Wednesday. During the trip, 12 Christian passengers were allegedly killed by Muslims from the Ivory Coast, Mali, and Senegal because of their religion. The arrested suspects are accused of murder at sea by Italian police. Thousands of migrants make the dangerous sea journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast annually to flee war and poverty. Since last weekend, more than 10,000 people have arrived on Italian shores from Libya alone, while hundreds die each year during the voyage, often when boats capsize.

      "In an unprecedented act of religious violence, 15 Muslim migrants, originating from the Ivory Coast, Mali, and Senegal, allegedly murdered 12 Christian migrants during a boat journey from Libya to Italy. The incident occurred on Tuesday during a journey across the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in the deaths of individuals from Nigeria and Ghana. According to Italian police, the alleged assailants targeted the 12 Christians on the boat because of their faith, sparing the lives of other passengers who protested the drowning attempt and formed a human chain. The boat was intercepted by an Italian navy vessel, and the passengers were transferred to a Panamanian-flagged ship, which docked in Palermo, Sicily, leading to the arrests of the 15 suspects. This tragedy underscores the ongoing perilous journey undertaken by thousands of migrants each year, seeking refuge from war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Despite the risks, more than 10,000 people have arrived on Italian shores from Libya since last weekend alone, with many losing their lives during the journey. The International Organization for Migration estimates that approximately 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean since 2000, and the latest boat sinking was reported on Thursday.\n",

      "The new study suggests that salty water may temporarily form as tiny puddles on Mars at night, strengthening the theory that brines could exist on the planet. This discovery is significant as brines could potentially explain channels observed on Mars that appear to have been formed by running water. However, the temperatures and water scarcity measured in the study are still too low to support terrestrial organisms, indicating that life on Mars remains unlikely. Nevertheless, the evidence of water ice at the planet's poles and the possibility of widespread brines keep researchers hopeful that they might find evidence of past life on Mars.\n",

      "A new study suggests that Mars could have small amounts of salty water at night, potentially forming brines, according to scientists. The research, based on a year's worth of data collected by the Mars Curiosity rover, indicates that certain conditions in Gale Crater might support brine formation. While the temperatures and water availability are still too low to support terrestrial organisms, the discovery strengthens the possibility that Mars once harbored life and may have widespread brines.

      "Scientists posit that this salt, when present in the soil, can draw water vapor from Mars' thin atmosphere and prevent it from freezing due to the extreme cold. While direct evidence of brine is yet to be found, the study appears to validate the theory, with researchers suggesting that if brines can exist in the least likely locations like Gale Crater, they could potentially persist for longer periods in other parts of Mars, possibly explaining the existence of channels observed on Mars that appear to have been formed by running water.\n",

      "Equal Pay Day, marking the point in the year women's wages would catch up to men's, occurs on Tuesday. The 77-cent wage gap statistic is misleading, as it doesn't account for factors like education, profession, and work experience. Clinton's election could center on women voters, and pay equity is a key concern for Democrats. Despite Republican claims that the \"war on women\" narrative is over, women voters remain valuable for Democrats.

However, the frequently cited 77-cent wage gap statistic is a misrepresentation. When accounting for factors such as education, profession, and work experience, the gender wage gap shrinks to about 4-6 cents.\n",

      "The misconception persists due to overlooked factors like women's choices and negotiation habits. The conservative party should pay heed to this issue, as women voters remain valuable to Democratic candidates. While the \"war on women\" narrative has shifted from political rhetoric to workplace issues, the right's silence on pay equity could be detrimental. A study by the Independent Women's Forum suggests that the left could win the public debate, but not the overall battle if conservatives fail to present their stance. Thus, it's advisable for the conservative party to engage in a meaningful discussion on pay equity to present a balanced and accurate view.\n",

      "The author argues that the wage gap statistic is misleading as it does not account for important factors influencing salary, such as education, profession, time spent in the workforce, and negotiation skills. However, a smaller wage gap persists, approximately 4-6 cents, partly due to gender discrimination and women's choices, including not negotiating as often as men.\n",

      "Equal Pay Day, a symbolic date marking the time it takes for women to earn what men did in the previous year due to wage disparities, is observed on Tuesday. The 77-cent wage gap statistic frequently cited is inaccurate as it fails to account for various factors such as education, profession, work experience, and negotiation skills. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign is expected to focus on pay equity and fairness in the workplace, but the actual wage gap is much smaller, around 4-6 cents. Despite the smaller wage gap, the Republican Party should not dismiss the issue, as women voters remain crucial. Recent election results indicated that voters preferred policy substance over gendered rhetoric, yet the \"war on women\" narrative persists, particularly concerning workplace issues like pay equity, paid leave benefits, and child care support. The Independent Women's Forum conducted an experiment that showed the progressive message in favor of closing the wage gap did not increase support for Democrats, implying that conservatives should not shy away from addressing the issue but instead present the accurate story on pay equity.\n",

However, the commonly cited 77-cent wage gap statistic overstates the disparity when not accounting for factors such as education, profession, and negotiation skills. Despite conservative assumptions that the \"war on women\" narrative has ended, women voters remain significant for both parties, with a 5-point national gender gap favoring Democrats. The right's silence on the issue of pay equity could lead to a lost opportunity to present a more accurate perspective, as demonstrated in a study by the Independent Women's Forum.\n",

However, the controversy raises questions about the importance of confronting slavery's past and the legacy of slavery in one's own family history. Affleck's reluctance to discuss his family's history contradicts his public support for foreign aid and humanitarian issues. The controversy could have been avoided had Affleck paid for a genealogist to uncover his ancestry or if he decided not to do the television show. The story came to light when Sony emails were hacked, revealing Gates' decision to remove the segment at Affleck's request violated PBS rules. Both Gates and Affleck have issued statements, with Gates maintaining editorial control and Affleck expressing regret over his initial reluctance to discuss the issue. The affair highlights the discomfort many white Americans have in discussing slavery, race, and persistent racism in American society.\n",

      "In the article, it is revealed that director Henry Louis Gates, of the PBS documentary series \"Finding Your Roots,\" allegedly edited a segment featuring actor Ben Affleck due to pressure from Affleck. The segment was to reveal Affleck's ancestor, Benjamin Cole, who was a slaveholder. Affleck, in a Facebook statement, expressed his embarrassment over the family's history. Gates later explained that he replaced the segment with another deemed more suitable for \"compelling television.\" However, the omission of the slave-owning ancestry segment was seen as a missed opportunity for discussing the importance of slavery's past to America's present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Affleck has been open about supporting various causes in the past. The incident is surprising considering his initial reluctance to acknowledge his slave-holding ancestry, something he later regretted. A teachable moment for the country could have been presented if Affleck had chosen to confront his family's history head-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The controversy arose when emails between Gates and Michael Lynton, CEO of Sony Entertainment, were leaked. In the emails, Lynton advised against airing the slave-owning ancestor segment due to sensitivity. Despite the potential violation of PBS rules, Gates proceeded with the editing. Gates later claimed editorial control over the content, and that he decided what made for the most compelling program\n",
