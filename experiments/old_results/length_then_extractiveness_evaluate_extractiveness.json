But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" \u00bc\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl.

The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance.

By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" \u00bc\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says.

Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" \u00bc\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community. \"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits.

Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" \u00bc\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says.

The summary should be normal in extractiveness. The input text is given below \n", "input": "Washington (CNN)Early Clinton campaign calculations, the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns, a GOP ticket for the generations, and Republican calendar concerns filled our Sunday trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. 1. Watch the volume as O'Malley uses YouTube to test Clinton pokes . Slowly but clearly, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. How aggressive will he get? Stay tuned -- literally. CNN's Jeff Zeleny says O'Malley enjoys using YouTube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by Clinton, like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver's licenses. \"Every time Hillary Clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from '08 to '16 -- her statement on the drivers' licenses that we discussed and other things -- Martin O'Malley has been releasing a YouTube video showing a speech where he has done something different, so watch for that to continue,\" said Zeleny. \"Those YouTube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race --the liberals love them.\" 2. The \"Obama Factor\": Clinton finds a lot to love, and some distance . Hillary Clinton is a big fan of President Obama's health care law, but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style. So reports AP's Lisa Lerer, who was in Iowa this past week for the Clinton campaign rollout, and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime Obama 2008 rival who, of course, went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state. \"She embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law, for his push for immigration legislation -- but it wasn't all sunshine and light,\" said Lerer. \"She also took subtle digs at his leadership style\u2014 she said America was on the wrong track-- I can't believe I'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a Republican.\" 3. In big policy choice, Clinton signals an important campaign focus . In Democratic politics, Kamala is the Harris sister who gets the most national buzz. But Maya Harris is about to play a big role in the question of how Hillary Clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes. Kamala Harris is the California attorney general and a 2016 Senate candidate, for the seat being vacated by Democrat Barbara Boxer. Maya Harris just signed on for a top policy role in the Clinton campaign -- and CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message. \"One clue, I think, is Maya Harris,\" said Henderson. \"Her resume is really a liberal's dream. She has worked at the Center for American Progress, ACLU, she's also done work on community policing and police reforming, and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate.\" \"So I think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that Hillary Clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color, who are so crucial to getting the Obama coalition back together again.\" 4. Walker-Rubio? Rubio-Walker? A general contrast with some GOP buzz . Marco Rubio drew a direct generational contrast with Hillary Clinton when he officially joined the GOP 2106 race, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also often talks of his hope Republicans will look for a next-generation leader as their next presidential nominee. In political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a Walker-Rubio pairing is not limited to inside the Beltway chatter. \"They both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that Clinton and Gore did ... in 1992,\" said Martin. \"But what's interesting is, in New Hampshire over the weekend, I was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates, for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- I heard somebody float the idea of a Walker-Rubio race in 2016.\" 5. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and then? Heading into the 2016 cycle, the Republican National Committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process, including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front-loaded. Now, some big GOP establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar. Florida is usually the next big contest, but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the \"SEC primary.\" It is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress. But what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a Super Tuesday -- or maybe back-to-back Tuesdays -- in early March that include a number of conservative Southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, maybe Louisiana. The shift is one reason former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008. Ditto for Rick Santorum. They did well in the South, but it didn't matter much because John McCain and Mitt Romney, respectively, were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted. Again, there might yet be more changes.

Watch the volume as O'Malley uses YouTube to test Clinton pokes . Slowly but clearly, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. How aggressive will he get? Stay tuned -- literally. CNN's Jeff Zeleny says O'Malley enjoys using YouTube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by Clinton, like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver's licenses. \"Every time Hillary Clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from '08 to '16 -- her statement on the drivers' licenses that we discussed and other things -- Martin O'Malley has been releasing a YouTube video showing a speech where he has done something different, so watch for that to continue,\" said Zeleny. \"Those YouTube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race --the liberals love them.\" 2. The \"Obama Factor\": Clinton finds a lot to love, and some distance . Hillary Clinton is a big fan of President Obama's health care law, but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style. So reports AP's Lisa Lerer, who was in Iowa this past week for the Clinton campaign rollout, and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime Obama 2008 rival who, of course, went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state. \"She embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law, for his push for immigration legislation -- but it wasn't all sunshine and light,\" said Lerer. \"She also took subtle digs at his leadership style\u2014 she said America was on the wrong track-- I can't believe I'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a Republican.\" 3. In big policy choice, Clinton signals an important campaign focus . In Democratic politics, Kamala is the Harris sister who gets the most national buzz. But Maya Harris is about to play a big role in the question of how Hillary Clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes. Kamala Harris is the California attorney general and a 2016 Senate candidate, for the seat being vacated by Democrat Barbara Boxer. Maya Harris just signed on for a top policy role in the Clinton campaign -- and CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message. \"One clue, I think, is Maya Harris,\" said Henderson. \"Her resume is really a liberal's dream. She has worked at the Center for American Progress, ACLU, she's also done work on community policing and police reforming, and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate.\" \"So I think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that Hillary Clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color, who are so crucial to getting the Obama coalition back together again.\" 4. Walker-Rubio? Rubio-Walker? A general contrast with some GOP buzz . Marco Rubio drew a direct generational contrast with Hillary Clinton when he officially joined the GOP 2106 race, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also often talks of his hope Republicans will look for a next-generation leader as their next presidential nominee. In political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a Walker-Rubio pairing is not limited to inside the Beltway chatter. \"They both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that Clinton and Gore did ... in 1992,\" said Martin. \"But what's interesting is, in New Hampshire over the weekend, I was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates, for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- I heard somebody float the idea of a Walker-Rubio race in 2016.\" 5. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and then? Heading into the 2016 cycle, the Republican National Committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process, including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front-loaded. Now, some big GOP establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar. Florida is usually the next big contest, but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the \"SEC primary.\" It is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress. But what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a Super Tuesday -- or maybe back-to-back Tuesdays -- in early March that include a number of conservative Southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, maybe Louisiana. The shift is one reason former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008. Ditto for Rick Santorum. They did well in the South, but it didn't matter much because John McCain and Mitt Romney, respectively, were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted.
